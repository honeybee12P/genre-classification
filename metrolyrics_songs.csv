Hip-Hop,21 Savage,No Heart,"Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a 12 car garage?
Why you pullin' all these rappers cards?
Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard
I turn that fucking soft into some hard
I grew up in the streets without no heart
I'm praying to my Glock and my cardI sit back and read like Cat in the Hat
21 Savage, the cat with the MAC
21 Savage not Boyz N The Hood but I pull up on you, shoot your ass in the back
Stuart Little, heard these niggas some rats
Pockets full of cheese, bitch I got racks
I'm a real street nigga bitch
I am not one of these niggas bangin' on wax
Pussy niggas love sneak dissing 'til I pull up on 'em, slap 'em out with the fire
Wet your mama's house, wet your grandma's house, keep shootin' until somebody die
So many shots the neighbor looked at the calendar, thought it was Fourth of July
You was with your friends playing Nintendo, I was playin' 'round with that fire
Seventh grade I got caught with a pistol, sent me to Pantherville
Eighth grade started playin' football, then I was like fuck the field
Ninth grade I was knocking niggas out, nigga like Holyfield
Fast forward nigga, 2016 and I'm screaming fuck a deal
Bad bitch with me, she so thick, I don't even need a pill
I listen to your raps, thought you was hard
You ain't even street for real
Niggas love sneak dissing on twitter
They don't want beef for real
And all these niggas play like they tough
'till a nigga get killed
'till a nigga get spilled, 'til your blood get spilled
I'ma at your favorite rapper, shoot him like I'm John Dill'
""I been with you since day one, Savage I ain't even hating""
So what's up with all that instagram shit?
""Savage I was just playin'""
Y'all pussy niggas fakin', bitch I hang around them Haitians
Pull up on you, tie your kids up
Pistol whip you while your bitch naked
""Come on man, Savage you know I always play your mixtape""
Yeah nigga fuck all that, ask your bitch how my dick tastes

Cooking up dope in Givenchys, all my niggas counting benjis
Pull up on you with the sticks nigga, we gon' handle business
I know a lot of niggas out here say they worth a mill ticket
I guess everybody rich, you a goddamn liar
Took the stand on your right hand man, so you had to die
Lost a lot of my real niggas so I had to cry
21 and that sex money what I live by
Glock 40 with the 30 round and a red dot
Young nigga went from hotboxing to a trap spot
Niggas clutching on the choppers every time the fuckin' door knock
Santan molly that'll make your fucking heart stop
Feds taking pictures every time the fucking car stop
Auntie hit the dope, she said it make her fucking jaw lock
Stray bullets hitting kids while they playing hop scotch
16 and pregnant ,told her momma and a fucking tear drop
And that's my soda, that's my stove and that's my pot

 "
Hip-Hop,21 Savage,Numb,"Grind hard, nigga, grind hard, I done grind hard
Late nights playin' b-ball with a decoy
I was on the corner with the robbers and the d-boys
Now I'm on the charts, man, this shit is unbelievable
Mama, it's a lot of secrets that I had to keep from you
Got in so much trouble, thought the teachers had beef with you
And it paid off 'cause we livin' like the Greeks and Jews
Used to leave your stove runnin', stove runnin'
Now it's Louis rags when my nose runnin'
Got it out the mud, I don't owe nothin'
You pussy-ass niggas ain't on nothin'
Wanna see me fucked up 'cause they poor hustlin'
The same niggas with me back when I was head itchin'
Man I'm having nightmares that the feds listenin'
You fake gangstas pump fakin' and they scared snitchin'
The coupe fast and it's fucking up the dash digital

Got your main bitch chillin', splashin', tryna lick it up
Dick ridin', niggas always tryna flick it up
I ain't tryna take no bitches, bitch I'm rollin' Swishers
I count my back end then I jump out with that pistol
If you ain't suckin' dick you get a early dismissal
We got your wifey at the spot, she tryna lick a pickle
I just went and bought a Lamb and it cost a nickel
And I came from the bottom and it feel good
And I went platinum, still in the hood
And I take the gang with me everywhere I go
Why these niggas hatin' on me? Man I don't know
Ain't a place in the world that I can't go
And I got a hundred racks inside a Go-Go
And I get a hundred racks for a show, show
Wanna give a bitch my heart but I can't though
I can't fall in love with a stank ho
Lil' bitch I fell in love with the bank ho
And you know I love that good drank, ho

You're my old school runner, you're my old school runner
But my new school runnin', it costs more than a hundred
You lil' niggas so bummy (21)
Make a diss song, they gon' wrap you like a mummy
My young niggas geekin' on [?] zombies
They hungry, up it on you then they tell you, ""Run it""
I stole cars, drove them like go-karts
Niggas actin' like bitches, they got both parts
And I came from the gutter, I don't got no heart
And I'm straight up out the gutter, I don't got no heart
Nigga when they killed my brother, I had to go hard
Put that chopper in his face and then I Bogart
Niggas tryna cross me, I don't understand it
I'm just tryna take care of the family
And I'm sippin' codeine, not brandy (21)
And I'm sippin' codeine, I'm a addict
You go to jail, can't depend on a bad bitch
She fucked and sucked him tryna keep up with the fashion
And I'm really, really rich and I ain't braggin'
Sometimes I really can't believe this shit happened
Who woulda thought I'd make it rappin'?

Ayy, fuck that other side, we gon' shoot up your Sprinter
I used to sell that crack and spray that MAC out that rental
Niggas run and hide when we roll down the window
Got a extendo and a hoodie, he can't wait 'til December
Got a extendo and a hoodie, he gon' shoot you on camera
Lost his faith in Jesus Christ, he prayin' to a bandana
Police gunned his brother down, this shit too hard to handle
Loading up his chopper, he gon' show 'em black lives matterAnother nigga made the news, it ain't nothin' new
He done dropped outta school, it ain't nothin' new
He done got his first tool, it ain't nothin' new
Mama own that dog food, it ain't nothin' new
He smokin' weed and he changin', it ain't nothin' new

Shit gettin' outrageous
Treat us like slaves then they lock us up in cages
Young, black, poor, ain't had a father since a baby
Why you think we skip school and hang out on the pavement?
Why you think we ridin' 'round with choppers off safety?
Streets cutthroat, nigga, so I'm cutthroat
I used to sell dope, nigga, now I can't vote
Poppin' Percocets to kill the pain, I can't cope
Anger in my genes, they used to hang us up with ropes
Civil rights came so they flood the hood with coke
Breakin' down my people, tryna kill our faith and hope
They killed Martin Luther King and all he did was spoke
Welcome to the hood, yeah where niggas dyin' at
Same place where the best chicken gettin' fried at
Same place where the police killin', tellin' lies at
It ain't just the babies, man, I swear the mama's cryin' now

She gon' hold my dope when I'm in need, she gon' bail me out when I'm in need

Do a lot of walkin' nigga, that's me

Late night, pullin' in the 'partments, all the scraps out
Scraps out, make the wrong move, get clapped out
Don't you think I'm slippin' just because a nigga rap now
Got a hoodie man, I'm the boogie man
We on that bullshit man, walk around with Uzis man
This a Mulsanne, not a Mustang
Let the .30 hang, nigga I'm so gang

Hood rats, now a nigga fuckin' on models
Ridin' in the foreign, remember ridin' on MARTA
Grind got harder and my mind got smarter
I was gettin' bags for the cheap
When I ain't had money, I was robbin', nigga
I was gettin' bags for the free
21 Gang, they were right beside me
And they still with me, nigga, I'm on TV
Couple niggas switched up, bitched up, fuck 'em
I can't go nowhere without a pistol or a rubber
I'm too, too player to put a bitch before my brother
I'm too street smart, nigga, to serve a undercover
Niggas tryna clone a nigga's shit, damn, woah
Used to drive a hotbox, shit, Lambo
Niggas want a handout, shit, mine broke
I grinded for this shit, I grinded for this shit
Can't change on my game, niggas still here
Kinda hard to change my ways 'cause the shit real
Niggas rappin' 'bout shit they ain't even lived
Niggas lyin', I can hear it in their ad-libs
I'm poppin' Percocets, bitch, not Advil
It's kinda fucked up what they did to Black, damn
If I catch him in the trap, I'ma whack him
I catch that boy in traffic, nigga, I'ma whack him
Nigga, try to keep up with this fashion
Makin' sure my kids happy
They dependent on their daddy
Tryin' not to let the streets distract me
I know it's bumps in the road like acne
Had to sell dope, I couldn't be an athlete
I'm a solid young nigga, you can ask C

I'm a street nigga, yeah I'm famous
I'm a rapper, nigga, and I'm gangbangin'
Everybody kill a nigga, what you claimin'?
Everybody get it with your nigga flamin'
All these chains on a nigga like I'm stranglin'
Ran off with your money, nigga, guess we straight then
You knockoff gangbangers ain't bangin'
In the hood everyday, I'm hangin'And I come through when the gang need
And I wear shades so they can't see
And I pay them lawyers and the bond fees
Nigga one thousand, I'm beyond G
I put my main bitch inside Givenchy
Niggas still askin', ""Can you front me?""
My old ho sayin', ""Boy you growed up""
Promethazine, it got a nigga slowed up
Too solid, pussy niggas can't disclose us
Went and seen Eliante, and he froze us
I'm too street to walk around with my nose up
Especially to the niggas knew me 'fore I blowed up
Savage Mode drop, now my price'll go up
Streets cold, nigga, they ain't showin' no love
Niggas get in front of judge and they fold up
Face shot, hit that boy with the whole dub

I'm a street nigga, yeah I'm famous
I'm a rapper, nigga, and I'm gangbangin'
Everybody kill a nigga, what you claimin'?

All these chains on a nigga like I'm stranglin'
Ran off with your money, nigga, guess we straight then
You knockoff gangbangers ain't bangin'
In the hood everyday, I'm hangin'Couple niggas switched up, bitched up, fuck 'em
I can't go nowhere without a pistol or a rubber
I'm too, too player to put a bitch before my brother
I'm too street smart, nigga, to serve a undercover




 "
Hip-Hop,21 Savage,Thug Life,"Scrape the corner
Buy a Rover
Crack inside my grandmas sofa
Sunday, family coming over
Move the crack behind the toaster
Carry pistols with no holsters
Trying not to be a poster
You was listening to your coaches
I was listening to the vultures
And I slept with rats and roaches
That's why I don't smoke no roaches
Niggas tryna knock my focus
Wonder why I'm sick of potion
We happy, dog but we ain't jokers
Big bullets, we ain't poking
In that pussy, slow motion
Nigga ain't none of my songs wrote

I'm thinking to myself you ain't gang, nigga, fuck you
Feel like 2Pac, Thug Life, nigga, fuck you
If he had the password to your phone he wouldn't have cuffed you
Dog ass bitch, I knew I never should've trusted youHoe stab a nigga in the back like the streets do
Can't believe that you betrayed me, I used to sleep with you
Niggas quick to say they loyal to you, they be see-through
Gang, gang, screaming ""Fuck you, they want to eat you""
My son got asthma, grandma having spasms
Fuck the chatter, he gon' tattle, put 'em on the platter
Snakes plotting on my downfall like I'm hearing rattle
(That fuck nigga gone flop man
21 ain't even no real nigga, fuck that nigga)
We sticking to the G code, nigga we ain't beefin' over freak ho's
I hit her on the D low, yeah she like my steelo
That nigga think that he a bullet, don't like credit, Deebow
30-round hangin' out the big Glock
Nigga, no six shots, shootin' 'til the clip stops
You a lil' cat, I'm a big dog
Nigga, when we pullin' up the stick's out
Too much money got 'em pissed off
Nigga, I'ma pull up at yo bitch house
Fuck a niggas bitch to get a kick out it
Nigga pop percs, 'gone get a kick out it
Drinking on syrup with my dick out
Glock-17 with the dick out

Slaughter gang top 5 crew, nigga spraying out of rentals
Young Savage real street nigga and you know a nigga rep that murder
And I'm solid as a motherfucker, young shell, nigga no turtle
Whole lotta hundreds and they blue
Whole lotta sticks and they new
Nigga what you gonna do
When we got them choppers pointed at you
Pull up nigga, send some shots at your boo
Baby mama with you, she get it too
Zone 6 niggas know how to shoot
Mally Mall, these nigga pass me the booth

[Verse]
Yeah young nigga pass me the scale
Young Savage and I run off with bails
Police say a nigga, you gonna tell
Blue hundreds, nigga keep me some bail money
Since a younging I was thugging
Since a younging I was hustling
I'm a young boss nigga, if it ain't about the blues, it ain't about nothing




 "
Hip-Hop,21 Savage,Feel It,"Now first of all where I'm supposed to start
When I first met you man another nigga had your heart
But I'ma player so you know a playa played his part
Smooth talkin', conversation took a nigga broad
I'm on the road doin' shows, seem like we fell apart
She think the nigga fuckin' groupies, I'm just grindin' hard
Your family said we wouldn't last but we beat the odds
Bonnie and Clyde, she was with a nigga stealin' cars
These streets so dirty I just want someone who really there
Can't fake love, just want someone who really care
Be loyal to me, want somebody I ain't gotta share
Open your eyes, baby girl, real niggas rare
All my dog ways, headin' for them in the kennel
I'ma savage to these niggas but to her I'm gentle
I'ma savage to these niggas but to her I'm gentle
I'm just sippin' on this mud, you was on my mental

I remember shoot outs niggas, broad day
Remember when I hit that nigga with the K
Niggas ain't loyal, nigga they'll betray you
Shoot 'em in the temple, give that nigga a fade
My dog got life and shit ain't been the same
All I got is money bags on my brain
Go hard in the booth and buy another chain

Got me thinkin' to myself

Cuz all the real niggas left
They either dead or down the road
Niggas goin' out bad
They'll kill you bout a ho
Man these streets so cold, so cold
I swear these streets so cold, so cold
I pray to god that he watch my soul
And let me know whose a friend or a foe

Don't bend, nigga don't fold
My uncle taught me how to scrape the bowl
And my auntie still smokin' blow
Came from nothin', nigga we was poor
Evection notices all on the door

Poppin' percocets on Rodeo Drive
Baby roll the window up and let's get high
You ain't no real nigga if you testify
I don't have to question where my niggas ride
If you gotta question, they ain't on your side

You know that we have always been down, down
If I ever didn't thank you, you
Then just let me do it nowLightning strikes, yo we be in that violent force of light
Guaranteed to turn it out as bad as dolemite
Because we're dope kid, change like a chameleon
And the channel whenever the wack show Real World is on
You know we dazzle like ghetto box boomin' battles
Rattle inside your head feel redeemed like cola bottles
Fall in love with your teachers, on the wax we are self made
Check the technique, 311 in L.A.We've changed a lot and then some, some
You know that we've always been down, down
If I ever didn't thank you, you
Then just let me do it now

Keep my feet on the ground
Keep my head in the clouds
Electrified by the sound
Comes from the down, and
We've changed a lot and then some, some
You know that we've always been down, down
If I ever didn't thank you, you
Then just let me do it now

Rock,311,Beautiful Disaster,"Today seems like a good day, to burn a bridge or two
The one with old wood creaking that would burn away right on cue
I try to be not like that, but some people really suck
people need to get the axing, chalk it up to bad luck

I know a drugstore cowgirl; so afraid of getting bored
She's always running from something; so many things ignored
I might do that stuff if it didn't make me feel like shit
I'm on some old reality tip so many trips in itBeautiful disaster
Flyin' down the street again
I tried to keep up
You wore me out and left me ate up
Now I wish you all the luck
You're a butterfly in the wind without a care
A pretty train crash to me and I can't care
I do I don't whateverI know a drugstore cowgirl; so afraid of getting bored

Rock,311,Hey Yo,"Send 'em up and watch them fall
Is anybody talking at all?Want it all reduced down to an equation
So many variables came up as unknown
So I stayed up all night long writing out the code
But by morning light I lost all my concentration, yeahHey yo, hey yo, is our mind even open at all?
Hey yo, hey yo, communication is broken, hit a wall
By the time we get out of line it's all over for composure
Hey yo, hey yo, do you hear what I'm saying?
Is our mind even open at all?Has the world ever granted you anything that you wish for?
Has your soul felt uncertain on a future outside your door?
Let the moments come, let go and let go and let go until it's all gone
Has the world ever granted you anything that you wish for?

Rock,311,Two Drops In The Ocean,"Thinking of you
It all comes in view
I believe we came from the same cloud
Two drops in the ocean
Tell me again
The story of when we
We will be together one day...We're two of a kind
Forever we've been combined
Though the current will pull us apart
Two drops in the ocean
You are part of me
The other side of the sea
And we will be together one day...

I swim your way
Though the tide pull us away
I ask you
What you gonna do?
Oceans apart
But I know no one else will do
Two drops in the ocean

From two rivers that dealt on two shore
Two drops in the oceanFall into me
Dissolve in the sea
The boundaries between, they are nothing
But love we have, the only real thing.yeah

There is a stone wall
Around your heart
Nothin left now to do but to start
Chippin away
Day by day
Until we see it break apart
Hear me talkin 'bout
Let it be known, it can be done
Bit by bit and one by one
If the two of us try from both the two sides
Until we see the sun
You're phenomenalTwo drops in the ocean
Just go with the motion.A lot of fish in the sea.

You're somethin' of a different kind

Which is really truly nothing
But you could bust me out all day
Many moons since first I saw you
Many moons since first we did the do
Many moonssince first I saw you

And why did I try when I knew it was no and
Why did I try when I say it was so
But save it forlate we should just let it skate

To be alive is lovin'.
Where the shore meets the sea
Man I'm hummin' I'm humminI'm free as I stare at the sea.
And I'm not comin' down.
The world is yours once you have found.
The good is to share.
Which is elsewhere.The beauty
of green is where light is now broken
by what it touches.
Remembering
what you once had told me hit home.
And hasn't it always been so.

It's human nature's attraction to danger
You look around but you won't see the rangers
Just crazy acting strangers acting up major
Acting up majorThe river cuts its way through stone
Not through sheer force but persistence
At the end of the day the relentless always winIf they wanted to stop us
Opportunity passed cause they hesitate

Made our way blindly for way too long
Made our way blindly for way too longOnly thing to stop us or cutting us off of
The road I've been told that ends in a drop off
The universe explodes, new galaxies pop up
New galaxies pop upLow on gas, going fast in the passing lane
All the light in the tunnel was an oncoming train
Out of sight, out of mind, now I'm stuck in a bind
That was the end of the lineLick shot, king of the block
It's going down another hard knock
That's all you've got
We'll turn it up in the mix
They'll hear it loud in the sticks
Relay the message from the downtowns
With loud sounds we expound
It will be too late

Circumvent the limits come through disarray
Greater ascension cause I was born to elevate
Never have been one to be cast away
We're going stronger, take it in along the way
I got this super OG and it goes crazy
It's an extension, this reach is so far away
Now we just break it on down, heyStand up and create could be on anything that we set our mind
United by fire to be undefined
Working all the time and gonna be hard because we came to play
That's because you wouldn't have it any other way
The reaches all the reaches of the intake of mind
I find a place where I can go where no one ever will find
I make a perfect exchange, I make it kind acting strange
Sometimes the places that I go make people think I'm deranged
If there's a reason that you're holding up the wall let it fall
I think it's treason when I'm sick of people throwing it all
I let them all just fly by with a quick wink to the eye
I think you all better quick just listen in your ride

Circumvent the limits come through disarray
Greater ascension cause I was born to elevate
Never have been one to be cast away
Stand undefeated in anything that we set
Our mind united by fire to be undefined
It's an extension, this reach is so far away
Now we just give you something sweetBecause the people lay heavy when they are so far away
Something about that decade they can't give a day
What do you play?
Thinking about the people we're jumping the two or three
We're keeping it dry till we goodbye the limits of the weight, heyIf there is a spirit and it's making our way
Seeing all the people traffic to it and they come around, they come around and
You look and bear it cause there's no other way
And so they step into the ground, they've all been getting down

We're breaking away from the past
reaching a new plane at last
regardless of what cards get played
no one can keep you afraidUnless you wanna be
you make that choice indubitably
they wanna play my emotions
but I'm like the ocean
too calm to get upset by somebody's notionFuture makers
organ takers
a non-human intelligence is guiding
worlds colliding
far away star system
I string DNA where I need 'emWhat we gonna get with a zero field
gotta have the one to make it real
I tell ya that more will be revealed
the mystery don't bother me
everyday masquerade
there's always too many plans we laid
keep going faster down the grade we madeWe're breaking away from the past
reaching a new plane at last
regardless of what cards get played
no one can keep you afraidWe're always beginning
as sure as we're spinning
for it's never ending from here
after all this time
I am sorry I'm not sorry
hate me later
something greater
than the petty here and nowVenture on

travel wide
it's not hiding inside
venture on
the sketch is not completely drawn
travel wide

I'm warning ya
Je vais a la plage parce que le guignol est chouette!
I kick nonsense in French tasty like Crepe Suzette
I bet you're feeling famished for a 311 sandwich
Not the wack DJ's that I'm a damage

And in my Continental you know that shit's booming
With the diamond in the back suicide doors
You can look from here to eternity
And never receive your morsel.

Another tale of ordinary madness
The girl who gave you her sex I heard was homeless say
All I really wanna is to feel nirvana
Won't you take me tonight and we just might find
A bottle of wine and feel our nasty nature
Your toung lickin' up my tounge
Your radio pickin' up a smokey jazz love song
Madness becomes you even though your
Livin' life it's hard to exist when you're tempted
By flesh you wanna bust through
Beautiful legs in the bar there is poetry
She bends and suspends and her ass
Is a marvelous thing
A dance dancin' at a club the Hereafter
Who can't really dance but that doesn't really matter
And she won't hear applause
Cus your drunk and lost
All light is gone
Your arms spread like a cross
And you're dreaming that the world
Will soon fall apart
Topless firl in your gaze
Which is hazy
Takes your dollar
In the gutter without cigarettes
Or wine your hungover
I was warned of your normal
Behaviour and felt
My life was too short to
Consider your wack self
It's like this when you dip down
And you are boxin'
Reeling against the ropes and you
Face some young Mexican
Your scrappin' your kneck gets
Snapped back your eyes have bled
Your thinking' about a comeback
But your takin' it to the head
You little bastard
Better watch you back
Cuz we're after
Your punk ass by God we're gonna jack it
You're played out and small time
And your show is over
You're 'bout as lucky as a three leaf clover
And your older ho bag sceezer
In her droopy saggy skin
Who thoughtshe was a model
But in truth a never-has-been
You both are fools
You and your cheap rooms too
The cigar biting your lips the way love use to

Rock,311,Flowing,"Along the way to close my eyes
I lost where I was going
the more it will spin
the more that I try
to stop my mind flowing away, away
to all that I despise
along the way to close my eyesYou can't be let down if you don't expect the world
expect to lay awake and by your sleeping girl
if somebody cares then there is no way you can tell
cursed consciousness is your private hell

You know that you have lost at the second you delay
Play the gate, it lies in your biology
Rising up the temperature, useless technology
Park the car and walk under the stars
So goddamn afraid to let down your gua-a-ard
You can see I'm talking bu-bu-but me
That's just what it is like in the wildfireIt's me me me

Pouring out my cranium on the m-i-c

Someone told you that you had no chance
People told us it would never transpire
You could be defeated in advance
Just let them all burn in the wildfireLet me tell you what you might not know
When the chips are down I mean lower than low
You might think this dude won't show
Cause I done robbed Knox and took all the gold
We'll overcome with our squad and we'll get in the mix
And you can pray to your god but your god can't fix
How I look at this world and if I am crying
It's cause I'm at the bigger life and I'm a die laughing
HahaWhether you think you can
Whether you think you can't
Either way you're right
Tell ya whether you think you can
Whether you think you can't

Someone told you that you had no chance
People told us it would never transpire
You could be defeated in advance
Just let them all burn in the wildfireLife goes on and on
The decisions so many times they make themselves
And in the aftermath
You cannot take it back
Your point of view is everything
That you're making
Rude awakening
Hate to be the one to tell you so
I thought that you should know
Cause that's what I'm here for
Told you I'd never goAnd when the morning comes
You know I'll still be here
One thing you should not fear
Whatever things that come
Through the rain
And the sunshine and the pain
We'll look back and smile
When all is said and been done
When the song is sung

Rock,311,Offbeat Bare-ass,"Any different people can apply to drop the funk
It's not a country club review board steady talkin junk
Many people would have it others go put and grab it
Some trip over toots and say fuck it I'm sunk
I put it in a limerick and kick the slick nick verbs
I am the one who scores the herb
When we're on the road P-Nut rolls it up
Throw me a joint on stage what's up
I will tell a cop that I know my fucking rights
And we can match wits all night for real
He said if I had nothing to hide
Then of course I wouldn't mind if he looked through our ride
Uh, no I'd really rather you didn't
And no we don't have guns hidden
We stood there for a while continue to decline
Firmly, I didn't lose my mind
I didn't let him break me he's just another human
Not a bit of shame in what we were doin' that day
He couldn't make us stay
We had our shit together
It don't matter whether
We sport the dread locks or a shaved head
Or if we have a sticker from the dead
I said a better verse rehearsed about the roughneck curse
Last week I keep an even keel and bow in place
And face the music every minute

Oh by now I'm chill with it
Bare ass in my face I'm ok but Chad's like ""Uh-uh no he isn't""
So I proceed to hear him get loose with the
Fartin' all over my face sometimes my tummy
He fucked with my flow although I thought it funny
I probably wouldn't care if I smoked more kind bud
But that wouldn't do me shit cuz then he'd fuck me more up
Crazy ill and chillin' rude but I'ze a real cool dude
He didn't believe the day would come when he would get his top
But then one day right in front of his face I got him
He looked over said ""God damn get me some water""
The one time I hadn't wasted till I got mine
Smeared his nose with my armpit funk slime
So you get it the picture just how sick we were then
But before I jet ""Hey yo Chad sniff my finger man""

Into whose womb were you woven what kin of your skin dropped you then
Bodies cloven
Light of daybreak blinded next exit
The wild darkness forming inside it
My day wasn't promised me each death it brings reminding me we
Are rumbling through this cursed universe where death is birth
Think not but what your manifest is worth
Giving up a verse the curse occurs a thirst
To burst first breaking through the center of the universe
Slamming down on the lingo flow so jam to the bumrush single
Long ago has been become now when you find out there's no break
In the rhythm. Black anima makes my stamina stand alone disown the cinema farewell to posing decades dozing comin up the steps of the new
Screen rising scenes from the lost world shapes hard to tell. Which is which as if drawn by a child holmesChorus

No one minds if you misbehaveYou gotta come on everyone as we set into the sun
Blending all the flavors only mixing in the perfect ones

Inferior spinning is my hand
I see a man like me standBetween mirrors and seem myself go all in lieu of them
Flowing, I didn't know my soul dig
Becomes the body of another one
Constellation, the mirror is such a simple above collectionAnd the mic down in my eye
Today we're taking out Paris or say
Of the lands heavy spirit of ill descending
Oh my God I made a mess haul
See mercury fall from hands flung

(Chorus)Now those sleepless nights thoughts just cloud up my brain
Feeling helpless repeating the same old memories of pain and I wish it would rain, yo
Gimme starlit skies fro dreamland
I know it's really smaller than it seems
But when the pressure gets under my skin
I just wanna get out and scream in the wind, yo
The world we're livin in is complicated
The streets that we walk on are dark and jaded
A wandering soul that's filled with hatred
In it is poison the youth is tainted
Social engineering keeps us seperated
Media control is highly overrated
Ignorance is bliss to those uneducated
Listen to the message cuz it's time we faced it(Chorus)

I'm controller of my destination
Gotta change my mind to help me break away
The sun creeps over the hillside to shed this light
No man could ever take away
I guess that's life you see a new side from the norm
A new direction and meaning to the form
And the calm in the eye of the storm, yo
Show me a desert that can never be drenched
I'll show you a thirst that can never be quenched
Temptation chronicles, the story of my life
Been spent on a dose of balancing strife
Inspiration it comes and goes
You can bet when it hits I'm on the phone
Singing to my voicemail trying to get it down
In a sensation of shape shifting sound
You're telling fables to cover up your foibles
From overindulgence on things you find enjoyable
Designed to take my mind away from truth
Try to make me play the sleuth
They want you to think someone's watching you
So they can make up a set of rules for you
I'm just trying to find a path that I can stomach
Just trying to make some sense out from it
Don't stop what you got
Don't stop til you find the sweet spot(Chorus)

You're gonna find out, kid, I'm 'bout to shock it
When I'm on I'm gone, I hear the beat that spawns
The way we freak it, and we kick up a storm
The day we turn to pop the show will stop, so
Feel the beat and get lost, now
Back to part two, the hard way we play
Sublime on time, to all the fans I'm SA
And if you don't know I say check the show
Do what you got to on the dance flo'
Some say the style is wack but I say fuck that
Get the hell back and watch us rock the set
We cast the mold, bust it cold explode
Mega-trendsetters known around the globe
Friends takin' you where you never been
We done what we wanted craftin' poems
You can rock, there is a glow around you
Lose control, holmes, just like we do

We're shooting up flares
Does anyone careThey got this world locked down bound and gagged
From the reds in Pine Ridge to that land in BagdadWhen did our leaders
Become bottom feeders
We're shooting up flares
Does anyone careThey got this world locked down bound and gagged
With constant fear and paranoia toxins in our headIt's just something they know how to do
How to make everyone feel uncalm
The masses just take it while they turn the screws
Bring to a boil, add oil, then bomb

In nineties try these you wanna just bust out.

Even if you are coming downSometimes it's wearable sometimes its bearable
I careen towards balance til' the glass is fullI wanna make a mess
I wanna blow off stress
I wanna stoke the fire
Just creatures for a whileI wanna make a mess
I wanna blow off stress
I wanna stoke the fire
Just creatures, just creaturesIt comes and goes it comes and goes
Sometimes
Sometimes I get a little out there
Sometimes I go off
Sometimes just like youI go a little crazy
Sometimes I go a little crazy just
Like you I do
Sometimes I go a little crazy
Sometimes I go a little crazy just like you I do




 "
Rock,311,How Do You Feel?,"I'm all right I feel real light
I don't live a life that's uptight
Where there's fight there's struggling
I can't walk through the world
Without offering questions
What's my direction
Breakin' the grip of depression
There comes a day when you let THINGS go
There comes a time to a rock showYou know the time that you feel
THAT nothing else really matters
You're on the spot in the world
AND you belong
That's where I am when the lights going down
I'll find a way to make some fun
I know that there is a link of energy
To someone

How do you feel?
Cuz I couldn't ask for
A single thing more
How do you feel?
The moment you know
Just what you are forI'm on a quest with a vision
I've got love and tradition
I wear a mask that grins and laughs
I remember what I've done
I'm a vibe under the sun
I penetrate all dimensions
I've come again
Rejuvenate within
I'm future animation

 "
Rock,311,Borders,"There are days I wanna leave LA
I wanna break out the maze
Escape the dark haze these days
So many kids I know your feelin' crazed
Crave material thangs and makin' slave wages
Baggy pockets only got laundry fluff
Livin' where rich people always buyin' some stuff
So you try to act tough and hide whats inside
Hold your head high gettin' fucked up and throwin' dice
As bad as yours and bad enough I'm sure
My heart wants to love but must navigate through war
Cuz seein' that we're wired to short circuit
Must mean the meek who will inherit the earth already work it

There's a land by the sand grab the money
Plastic the life end of the century
People actin' fake can't see the omens
Wake up yourself cause change is comin'
There's a land by the sand grab the money
Hollywood is such a place fuelin' the frenzy
And everybody starts to peep around corners
Before they take their next step they know their bordersIn this $19.98 plus shipping and handling type
Netherworld everytime merchandise dips in our coffers
We buy that image that cost of livin' uh huh
The fakest shit and act cool our friends are watchin'
Attention shoppers check the selection in our reflection
Don't you feel good does it enhance your fresh complexion
You gotta have it you got got to have it (2x)
As the world turns and all the money we burn
On the bullshit to make us happy sometimes we never learn
We're self centered we think were better
We look down as a people upon our elders

There's a land by the sand grab the money
Now let go of it cause it's dissolving
It created all your fears and kept you hustling
Made you sever all the ties to your family

Plastic the life end of the century
People actin' fake can't see the omens
Wake up yourself cause change is comin'

Rock,311,Get Down,"I got this great idea about why I got stuck in reverse
I was so out of control it just got worse
I hope you got more sense than I, side step the curse
I don't know which came first
In the spiral threatening my survival
It's come, time to get downIt's time to get down
Boots to the ground
Know we don't stop 'til they hear the bell sound
Keep your head up
Cause the truth just cut
No quick fix when I'm caught in a rut
What I got to do to get right size
Think I'm despised when I look through the eyes
Of another
Not mine to discover
What the next man think is none of my fucking business

My treasure is soul, aren't you glad

Find it difficult to be so analytical

The rope it won't hang you
Sit your ass down and come in rangoon

Feel the earth turn 'round when your heart rate slows

Part of me will fade
In a mystery

The natural way that things organize
You can't stop entropy so why even try
Observe the conscious flow and don't mystify

And boss DJ illness upon you now quickly
Infecting you fast upon the airwaves

Activate and attune yourself with mediation
And green plants they've got mad life they're sentient
They're beautiful as you and they like to danceEverything we do we gotta come original
Put your hand up in the air and prepare for battle
Sit upon the rhythm like a tire upon a rim
We do it non-stop and then we do it again
Some of them whine and some of them bitch
They can not do it never switch
Comin' up from the heart and
Delivered with a wild pitch
Sit up on top the rhythm like a wild stallion

It's a long road up to the top of the mountain
We'll ride it out to the end
It's a long way down so let's stay in the trade wind

All as one here we goLet's keep it all together

Gonna keep it all together
It's only getting better
Let's keep it all together

Rock,311,I'll Be Here While,"I'll be here a while, ain't going nowhere
I'll be here a while, ain't going nowhere
I'll be here a while, ain't going nowhere
I'll be here a while
Far is solace in the maddening pace
Sad state written on my face
Not a tight rope walk but dance
Uncertain game of chance
But I'll see it through in time
I'll be here a while, ain't going nowhere
I'll be here a while, ain't going nowhere
I'll be here a while, ain't going nowhere
I'll be here a while
And if a person, place or thing can deliver
I would quiver with delight
Tempted by the hand that could
Blind my vision and sight
But at twenty years of age
In frolic and in rage
I will see it through in time
I'll be here a while, ain't going nowhere
I'll be here a while, ain't going nowhere
I'll be here a while, ain't going nowhere
I'll be here a while
But the dawn has come into the endless night
And everything's gonna be all right
But at thirty years of age
Through frolic and in rage
All regressed and healed in time
I'll be here a while ain't going nowhere
Said I, said I, said I
I will survive

 "
Rock,311,Stealing My Girl,"I want to thank you for stealing my girl away
You did a favor for me
OK I admit it
It didnt go down that way
But my excuse to be free
I dont know whats the problem with me
I guess I ask for a clue
It would be better
If I just took the blame honestly
Instead of pointing to you
Instead of blaming it on you

Where did all our plans go
They just flew right out the window
I dont know why I act this way
Id like to hear what you have to say
When was it the vision died
I woke up one day and the well had dried
I dont know why you acted that way
You dont want to hear what I have to sayThere are days I thought were just too good
Another time right there I knew where we stood
The house cooled as you knew it would
You saw it coming you could
We were young, and we were unafraid
Where was I when you were there and you gave
I was gone when the deal was made
The day would oblong way

Rock,311,From Chaos,"From chaos comes clarity, I tell ya
What you appear to be, you ought to know
Glycerin tears don't fool me, I tell ya
Delusions plaguing everybodyMakin that hybrid music back in '90 now it's on ya
I hear we were the model for the band you front we spawned ya
Finding it hard to come original we warned ya
We're shakin the white boys in New York, black girls in California
We come through hip-hop drum-n-bass and dancehall rhythms
You want our beats and lyrics you want to get them
Watchin you sink into the depths of opportunism
Missing the point, music's about love not pessimism
I'm SA moving supreme and on my team
I rock the mic with a sweet lean
And you know that stated as a fact the only DJ MC gettin down like that
Metaphorically we are the chief of police you're rock n' roll
And we're positive you stole more than just the radio
Now it's 2-1 and we are back in control
The jammies are coming, people succumbing cuz we got the soulEveryone tends to forget upon re-entry
Orbiting space quantum saints we're the only
Beginning from a planet so naturally
Gifted in the heart lies our technology
It's only right, right
Entering in a space of pure delight, light
Next contestant on this jam is, tight
Feels spontaneous you'll improvise, vise

Don't even try it, you don't want to disrespect me
If dealing with punks was school, I'd have a Harvard degree
You can't make me hate you no matter how punk you act
No matter what you do I don't react
I'm a perfect example of not giving a f--k
About the catty rude people that just suck
What do you know all of the sudden, uh I usurp you
Look it up in the dictionary to find out what I do
I go back to the style I came from
It's not something you can fake son
You're a con man who's run is done
You lead a world wide web of deception

Pop,5 Seconds Of Summer,Amnesia,"I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
I thought about our last kiss, how it felt the way you tasted
And even though your friends tell me you're doing fineAre you somewhere feeling lonely even though he's right beside you?
When he says those words that hurt you, do you read the ones I wrote you?Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?'Cause I'm not fine at allI remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

Pop,5 Seconds Of Summer,Wrapped Around Your Finger,"Throwing rocks at your window at midnight
You met me in your backyard that night
In the moonlight you looked just like an angel in disguise
My whole life seemed like a postcardYou were mine for a night
I was out of my mind
You were mine for a night
I don't know how to say goodbyeMaking all our plans in the Santa Cruz sand that night
I thought I had you in the palm of my hand that night
Screaming at the top of my lungs 'til my chest felt tight
I told myself that I'm never gonna be alright

He's saved for Harvard, he knows she'll make it
She's good at school, she's never truant
She can speak French, and I think she's fluent'Cause every night she studies hard in her room
At least that's what her parents assume
But she sneaks out the window to meet with her boyfriend
Here's what she told me the time that I caught 'emShe said to me, forget what you thought
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught
So just turn around and forget what you saw

She's a good girl
A straight A-student
She's really into all that self-improvement
I swear she lives in that library
But if you ask her she'll say,""That's where you'll find me!""But if you look then you won't find her there
She may be clever but she just acts too square
'Cause in the back of the room, where nobody looks,
She'll be with her boyfriend, she's not reading booksShe said to me, forget what you thought
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught
So just turn around and forget what you saw

Let's forget the past
I swear we'll make this last
'Cause I remember the taste of your skin tonight
And the way that you looked, you had those eyes
I remember the way I felt inside
And the name of the songs that made you cry
You would scream, we would fight, you would call me crazy
I would laugh, you were mad but you'd always kiss me
And the shirt that I had that you always borrowed
When I woke, it was gone
There was no tomorrowI want you to want me this way,

She would hope, she would pray, she was waiting it out
Holding onto a dream while she watches these walls fall down
Sharp words like knives, they were cutting her down
Shattered glass like the past, it's a memory now
Holding onto a dream while she watches these walls fall downHey mom, hey dad, when did this end?
Where did you lose your happiness?
I'm here alone inside of this broken home
Who's right, who's wrong, who really cares?
The fault, the blame, the pain's still there

Wrote it down on the walls, she was screaming it out
Made it clear, she's still here, are you listening now?
Just a ghost in the halls feeling empty, they're vacant now
All the battles, all the wars, all the times that you've fought
She's a scar, she's the bruise and she's the pain that you brought
There was life, there was love like a light and it's fading outHey mom, hey dad, when did this end?

 "
Pop,5 Seconds Of Summer,Lost In Reality,"You throw me around like a rag doll
And throw me away like your cigarettes
Then pick up the pieces of whatever's left of me
They're yours to keep
A million and one ways that I've tried
To turn it around, leave it all behind
But every time you turn out to be one step ahead of meLost in reality
I can feel you in the dark when I fall asleep
All that's in my head are pictures of memories, words that you said to me
Hey, hey, Hailey, won't you save me?
Bittersweet chemistry
I can't escape you anywhere even in my dreams
All that's in my head are pictures of memories, words that you said to me
Hey, hey, Hailey, won't you save me?

Lying here no fear of the darkness

Damn, she's so amazingLast night, what a blur
Woke up lying next to her
Last night, made a mess
Doesn't get better than this
Phone rings from the bar
25 texts and a call from mom
It must've been good 'cause I can't remember!Last night, what a blur
Woke up lying next to her
Last night, made a mess
Doesn't get better than this
Phone rings from the bar
25 texts and a call from mom

And it comes with a cost of being alone
Everything is falling down, were suffering
Helpless thoughts, and out we sing
Prayers go to the skyAnd if the earth ends up crumbling down to its knees then baby
We just gotta get out, we just gotta get out
And if the skyscrapers tumble down and crash around baby
We just gotta get out, we just gotta get outAnd if we fall, it's not your fault

Holding onto things I can't replaceI'm looking for a way to change my mind, don't walk awayOh, tell me what we're fighting for
This turned into an all-out war
I'll find a way to fix these broken pieces and let go
I'm trying to find our way back home

I'll find a way to fix these broken pieces and let go

Pop,5 Seconds Of Summer,Heartache On the Big Screen,"Started out like in the movies.
But it ended like a bad dream.
Curtain opened, heard the crowd roar
This one's a repeat, seen it before.Rewind to the start before it all went wrong.
Whats going on?
Fast forward to the end, after everyone's gone home.
And they've forgotten it all.This ain't a movie that I wanna see.
A tragic story, starring you and me.
Yell ""cut"", we're stuck inside this scene.
This is heartache on the big screen!
The clock is ticking, and I'm out of time.
The camera's rolling, and I forgot my line.
My script is wripped now I see.

Curtain closes on this cliche.
A good story of a bad day.
Back to square one, where I started.
As I stand here, broken hearted.Fast forward to the end, after everyone's gone home.
And they've forgotten it all.This ain't a movie that I wanna see.
A tragic story, starring you and me.
Yell ""cut"", we're stuck inside this scene.
This is heartache on the big screen!
The clock is ticking, and I'm out of time.

This is heartache on the big screen!If Hollywood could see me now,
I'd get the starring role
But they won't so I'll just keep on acting a fool.

He's gotta get out of this body.
His lungs collapse on the side of his guitar,
Regrets with nothing left so far.
'Cause he knows when or not to play himself.He wears the perfect disguise
That keeps them on their feet.
Tryna' play Prince Charming,
When he's dying within.
Tells himself he gotta be real,
Tells himself he's going to steal the scene.
He's asking the question
Whether he's messing around or he's serious.

Please and thank you.
'Cause he gotta get his head outta the sky.
And a decision to lie,
To keep him fine.

Time can't buy

It's like an island,
Oppressed and we're poor.
If this turns out the way
It's supposed to go,
It feels so right,
When everything's so blind in the lights.He wears the perfect disguise
That keeps them on their feet.
Tryna' play Prince Charming,
When he's dying within.
Tells himself he gotta be real,
Tells himself he's going to steal the scene.

I couldn't get you out of my head
There was always something about you
Every chance that I seem to get
Finds a way to end in regret
There was always something about you
Jealousy keeps containing me
In time you'll see
Just what we could beBut I'm always too late
I'm always too late
I see you but I always hesitate
'Cause I'm always too late
Don't wanna be too late
To have you by my side and I can't wait

Hide you through this

The bleeding heart perched on my shirt
Die, withdraw
Hide in cold sweat
Quivering lips
Ignore remorse
Naming a kid, living wasteland
This time you've tried
All that you can turning you red
Change my attempt good intentions
Should I, could I
Here we are with your obsession
Should I, could I
Crowned hopeless

Should I, could I
Heave the silver hollow sliver
Piercing through another victim
Turn and tremble be judgmental
Ignorant to all the symbols
Blind the face with beauty paste
Eventually you'll one day know
Change my attempt good intentions
Limbs tied, skin tight
Self inflicted his perdition
Should I, could I
Change my attempt good intentions

This isn't how I thought I'd turn outIn your eyes, I'm picture perfect

We're hypnotized, by televised train wrecks

Why don't you see
That we cannot
Survive in this condition
If you're cut
I'll bleed
So go on
Carve into your own heart
I could use a new scar
Or a brand new start
Slowly severing
The only memories
That bind us as one
I just don't know
How to win
How to win
With you
And I can't let go
Part of me
Part of me
Is you
We have lost
All communication
When words fall
On deaf ears
I'm starting to
Feel a transformation
How did I get here
I don't recognize
My own reflection
It's a ghost of
What once was
Gone from relative to
Stranger separating
Body from mind
I just don't know
How to win
How to win
With you
And I can't let go
Part of me
Part of me
Is you
You stay the same
Allowing me to change
I just don't know
How to win
How to win

And I can't let go

Physically and mentally, pressures made fruity
Remember to appreciate the bittersweet
Finding symmetry so hard to achieve
Expectations test abilities
Life is but a dream
In our sleep, let us seeSo long I've been waiting patiently
You're not all alone
So lost, I've been searching patiently
We're not all aloneSleep well
All alone

Rock,10 Years,Chasing The Rapture,"Wounded words from sharpened tongues
Are spewing from our mouths
Without a translation
We're just making soundsThe pride of a lion is your disguise
But the fear of a coward's in your eyesYou're chasing the rapture
Praying for a
Perfect disaster
To save us from ourselvesWe need more than miracles
We need to answer
For the blood on our hands now
And save us from ourselves

Humbling to sit back and watch through

Clearly no mercyLove in time grows stagnant

Rabidly adapting struggle with this gravity

Constantly consuming days
Without a clue of what to do, stumbling on as reckless youth trying to find some truth
Ashes to ashes; dust into dust

Ashes into ashes, dust into dust
Lay your memories out to rust

Love in time grows stagnant
The innocence we have lost
New grains of time will not rewindInjuries strain from her perfect art of guile
Swindling her space
In despair
Shed a tear of mock sincerity
Condescending hearts can display
Cracks as your zone if comfort starts to fray
Humbling to sit back and watch through
All of the actions that got you
Clearly no mercyLove in time grows stagnant
The innocence we have lost
New grains of time will not rewind

Where shallow graves grow
Too old to die youngSo dammed hard to find serenity
Never fret why the dead don't fly

Keep you safe from the harm that you felt before

Praying you'll give us just one more chance

Pop,98 Degrees,She's Everything You Want,"Somewhere there's speaking
It's already coming in
Oh and it's rising at the back of your mind
You never could get it
Unless you were fed it
Now you're here and you don't know whyBut under skinned knees and the skid marks
Past the places where you used to learn
You howl and listen
Listen and wait for the
Echoes of angels who won't return

Chorus
She's everything you want
She's everything you need
She's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
She says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But she means nothing to you
And you don't know whyYou're waiting for someone
To put you together
You're waiting for someone to push you away
There's always another wound to discover
There's always something more you wish she'd sayChorus

But you'll just sit tight
And watch it unwind
It's only what you're asking for
And you'll be just fine
With all of your time
It's only what you're waiting forOut of the island
Into the highway
Past the places where you might have turned
You never did notice
But you still hide away
The anger of angels who won't returnChorus
I am everything you want
I am everything you need
I am everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
I say all the right things
At exactly the right time
But I mean nothing to you and I don't know why
And I don't know why
Why
Why
I don't know

and that's why it's hard just to be friends with you.
Everytime your heart is broken by the fool
I want you to know that it hurts me too.
It's hard to wipe your tears away.
Knowing that you should be with me.
Now tell me why.Why, why are we still friends
when everything says we should be more than we are?
and tell me why
everytime I find someone that I like
we always end up just being friends.

'Cause you know (you know) that love will find a way
To reach your heart again someday
You must believe it's true
Now all you have to do...(well) You've got to leave it all behind you (oh no)
Break through those lonely chains that bind you
'Cause love's not far away, (far away)
it's gonna find your heart someday
(find it one day)(it'll find your heart someday)
And when you feel it's warmth surround you (oh oh oh ohhh)
You'll realize that love has found you
So turn away your fears
'Cause the love that you've been looking for, is here...




 "
Pop,98 Degrees,Still,"Love, I see forever in your eyes
I can see heaven in your smile
And when I hold you close
I don't want to let go
Because deep in my soul I know girlYou are the only light I see
Your love means everything to me
I know that we will never part
Cause you'll always be near, here in my heartIf the sun should refuse to rise
And the moon doesn't hang in the night
The tides won't change, seasons rearrange
When the world is through
I will still love you

Pop,98 Degrees,Away In A Manager (traditional),"Away in a manger, no crib for a bed,
The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweethead.
The stars in the bright sky looked down where he lay,
The little Lord Jesus asleep in the hay.The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes,
But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.
I love thee, Lord Jesus!Look down from the sky,
And stay by my bedside till morning is nigh.
Be near me, Lord Jesus; I ask thee to stay,
Close by me forever, and love me, I pray.
Bless all the dear children in thy tender care,
And lift us for heaven, to live with thee there.

Devastate a room, take an inch and then a mile
When it's all said and done, she's still the only one, one, one.(Pre-Chorus)
And I wasted every word I didn't say, she never heard
I wish this was a mixtape I could play past and erase
But it's love, love, love.(Chorus)
I wanna watch my own parade, I wanna bring back yesterday,
I'd split atoms if I had 'em, but I don't, so anyway
I wanna write it on the moon,

And folks dressed up like EskimosEverybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Helps to make the season bright
And Tiny tots with their eyes all a-glow
Will find it hard to sleep tonightThey know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

 "
Pop,98 Degrees,Thank God I Found You,"I would give up everything
Before I'd separate myself from you
After so much suffering
I finally found the unvarnished truth
I was all by myself for the longest time
So cold inside
And the hurt from the heartache would not subside
I felt like dying
Until you saved my life

Chorus:
Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
Cause baby I'm so thankful
I found youI would give you everything
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
To ensure your happiness
I'll cherish every part of you
Because without you beside me I can't survive
I don't wanna try
If you're keeping me warm each and every night
I'll be all right
Cause I need you in my life

Chorus:
Thank God I found you (I'm thanking you)
I was lost without you (so lost without you)
My every wish and every dream (every dream, every dream)
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight (brought the sunlight)
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
Cause baby I'm so thankful
I found youSee I was so desolate
Before you came to me
Looking back I guess it shows
that we were destined to shine
After the rain to appreciate
The gift of what we have
And I'd go through it all over again
To be able to feel this wayChorus:
Thank God I found you
I was lost without you (lost without you baby)
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life (whole life)
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
Sweet baby I'm so thankful

Pop,98 Degrees,Lonely,"(Verse)
I caught myself again laying in bed starring at your picture
I told myself I wouldn't do that anymore.
The afternoon is my morning, it's almost 4PM
Before I get up and drag myself out the door.
It's like my whole world is in slo-mo
And I lost the one thing that made it go.So now I just walk around, reliving that moment
Over and over and over again
I'm so lonely.
If I knew then what I know now
I wouldn't keep calling and hanging up
Over and over and over again
Cause I'm so lonely.
(Verse)
The answers always seem to come after the damage is done
Life's little way of laughing in your face.
I can't unbreak the broken heart
So I sympathize by let me fall apart.

But please don't go and stay away.

And it cuts like a knife (cuts like a knife)

To think for two years that she was here
And I took her for granted
I was so cavalier
Now the way that it stands
She's out of my hands
And so.
So I've learned, that love is no possession
And I've learned, that love won't wait yeah
Now I've learned, love needs expression
But I've learned (learned) much too late
And she's out of my life
Out of my life
Damned indecision and cursed pride
Kept my love for her locked deep inside
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life

She's out of my life
