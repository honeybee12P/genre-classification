 "
Hip-Hop,21 Savage,No Heart,"Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a 12 car garage?
Why you pullin' all these rappers cards?
Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard
I turn that fucking soft into some hard
I grew up in the streets without no heart
I'm praying to my Glock and my cardI sit back and read like Cat in the Hat
21 Savage, the cat with the MAC
21 Savage not Boyz N The Hood but I pull up on you, shoot your ass in the back
Stuart Little, heard these niggas some rats
Pockets full of cheese, bitch I got racks
I'm a real street nigga bitch
I am not one of these niggas bangin' on wax
Pussy niggas love sneak dissing 'til I pull up on 'em, slap 'em out with the fire
Wet your mama's house, wet your grandma's house, keep shootin' until somebody die
So many shots the neighbor looked at the calendar, thought it was Fourth of July
You was with your friends playing Nintendo, I was playin' 'round with that fire
Seventh grade I got caught with a pistol, sent me to Pantherville
Eighth grade started playin' football, then I was like fuck the field
Ninth grade I was knocking niggas out, nigga like Holyfield
Fast forward nigga, 2016 and I'm screaming fuck a deal
Bad bitch with me, she so thick, I don't even need a pill
I listen to your raps, thought you was hard
You ain't even street for real
Niggas love sneak dissing on twitter
They don't want beef for real
And all these niggas play like they tough
'till a nigga get killed
'till a nigga get spilled, 'til your blood get spilled
I'ma at your favorite rapper, shoot him like I'm John Dill'
""I been with you since day one, Savage I ain't even hating""
So what's up with all that instagram shit?
""Savage I was just playin'""
Y'all pussy niggas fakin', bitch I hang around them Haitians
Pull up on you, tie your kids up
Pistol whip you while your bitch naked
""Come on man, Savage you know I always play your mixtape""
Yeah nigga fuck all that, ask your bitch how my dick tastes

Shit gettin' outrageous
Treat us like slaves then they lock us up in cages
Young, black, poor, ain't had a father since a baby
Why you think we skip school and hang out on the pavement?
Why you think we ridin' 'round with choppers off safety?
Streets cutthroat, nigga, so I'm cutthroat
I used to sell dope, nigga, now I can't vote
Poppin' Percocets to kill the pain, I can't cope
Anger in my genes, they used to hang us up with ropes
Civil rights came so they flood the hood with coke
Breakin' down my people, tryna kill our faith and hope
They killed Martin Luther King and all he did was spoke
Welcome to the hood, yeah where niggas dyin' at
Same place where the best chicken gettin' fried at
Same place where the police killin', tellin' lies at
It ain't just the babies, man, I swear the mama's cryin' now

We got something real special

I was finna text you
But I don't wanna pest you
Even if we ain't together (no matter we're forever)
I'm still coming to your rescue




 "
Hip-Hop,21 Savage,Numb,"Grind hard, nigga, grind hard, I done grind hard
Late nights playin' b-ball with a decoy
I was on the corner with the robbers and the d-boys
Now I'm on the charts, man, this shit is unbelievable
Mama, it's a lot of secrets that I had to keep from you
Got in so much trouble, thought the teachers had beef with you
And it paid off 'cause we livin' like the Greeks and Jews
Used to leave your stove runnin', stove runnin'
Now it's Louis rags when my nose runnin'
Got it out the mud, I don't owe nothin'
You pussy-ass niggas ain't on nothin'
Wanna see me fucked up 'cause they poor hustlin'
The same niggas with me back when I was head itchin'
Man I'm having nightmares that the feds listenin'
You fake gangstas pump fakin' and they scared snitchin'
The coupe fast and it's fucking up the dash digital

[Verse 1]
Cooking up dope in Givenchys, all my niggas counting benjis
Pull up on you with the sticks nigga, we gon' handle business
I know a lot of niggas out here say they worth a mill ticket
I guess everybody rich, you a goddamn liar
Took the stand on your right hand man, so you had to die
Lost a lot of my real niggas so I had to cry
21 and that sex money what I live by
Glock 40 with the 30 round and a red dot
Young nigga went from hotboxing to a trap spot
Niggas clutching on the choppers every time the fuckin' door knock
Santan molly that'll make your fucking heart stop
Feds taking pictures every time the fucking car stop
Auntie hit the dope, she said it make her fucking jaw lock
Stray bullets hitting kids while they playing hop scotch
16 and pregnant ,told her momma and a fucking tear drop
And that's my soda, that's my stove and that's my pot

I was listening to the vultures
And I slept with rats and roaches
That's why I don't smoke no roaches
Niggas tryna knock my focus
Wonder why I'm sick of potion
We happy, dog but we ain't jokers
Big bullets, we ain't poking
In that pussy, slow motion

I'm thinking to myself you ain't gang, nigga, fuck you
Feel like 2Pac, Thug Life, nigga, fuck you
If he had the password to your phone he wouldn't have cuffed you
Dog ass bitch, I knew I never should've trusted youHoe stab a nigga in the back like the streets do
Can't believe that you betrayed me, I used to sleep with you
Niggas quick to say they loyal to you, they be see-through
Gang, gang, screaming ""Fuck you, they want to eat you""
My son got asthma, grandma having spasms
Fuck the chatter, he gon' tattle, put 'em on the platter
Snakes plotting on my downfall like I'm hearing rattle
(That fuck nigga gone flop man
21 ain't even no real nigga, fuck that nigga)
We sticking to the G code, nigga we ain't beefin' over freak ho's
I hit her on the D low, yeah she like my steelo
That nigga think that he a bullet, don't like credit, Deebow
30-round hangin' out the big Glock
Nigga, no six shots, shootin' 'til the clip stops
You a lil' cat, I'm a big dog
Nigga, when we pullin' up the stick's out
Too much money got 'em pissed off
Nigga, I'ma pull up at yo bitch house
Fuck a niggas bitch to get a kick out it
Nigga pop percs, 'gone get a kick out it
Drinking on syrup with my dick out
Glock-17 with the dick out

Hood rats, now a nigga fuckin' on models
Ridin' in the foreign, remember ridin' on MARTA
Grind got harder and my mind got smarter
I was gettin' bags for the cheap
When I ain't had money, I was robbin', nigga
I was gettin' bags for the free
21 Gang, they were right beside me
And they still with me, nigga, I'm on TV
Couple niggas switched up, bitched up, fuck 'em
I can't go nowhere without a pistol or a rubber
I'm too, too player to put a bitch before my brother
I'm too street smart, nigga, to serve a undercover
Niggas tryna clone a nigga's shit, damn, woah
Used to drive a hotbox, shit, Lambo
Niggas want a handout, shit, mine broke
I grinded for this shit, I grinded for this shit
Can't change on my game, niggas still here
Kinda hard to change my ways 'cause the shit real
Niggas rappin' 'bout shit they ain't even lived
Niggas lyin', I can hear it in their ad-libs
I'm poppin' Percocets, bitch, not Advil
It's kinda fucked up what they did to Black, damn
If I catch him in the trap, I'ma whack him
I catch that boy in traffic, nigga, I'ma whack him
Nigga, try to keep up with this fashion
Makin' sure my kids happy
They dependent on their daddy
Tryin' not to let the streets distract me
I know it's bumps in the road like acne
Had to sell dope, I couldn't be an athlete
I'm a solid young nigga, you can ask C
The internet ain't gon' help you understand me

I'm a street nigga, yeah I'm famous
I'm a rapper, nigga, and I'm gangbangin'
Everybody kill a nigga, what you claimin'?
Everybody get it with your nigga flamin'
All these chains on a nigga like I'm stranglin'
Ran off with your money, nigga, guess we straight then
You knockoff gangbangers ain't bangin'
In the hood everyday, I'm hangin'And I come through when the gang need
And I wear shades so they can't see
And I pay them lawyers and the bond fees
Nigga one thousand, I'm beyond G
I put my main bitch inside Givenchy
Niggas still askin', ""Can you front me?""
My old ho sayin', ""Boy you growed up""
Promethazine, it got a nigga slowed up
Too solid, pussy niggas can't disclose us
Went and seen Eliante, and he froze us
I'm too street to walk around with my nose up
Especially to the niggas knew me 'fore I blowed up
Savage Mode drop, now my price'll go up
Streets cold, nigga, they ain't showin' no love
Niggas get in front of judge and they fold up
Face shot, hit that boy with the whole dub

Your baby brother used to be my crash dummy
Don't call my phone if it ain't 'bout cash money
I don't wanna talk if it ain't 'bout cash money
I got a lot of shooters 'round me and they hungry
He sold a zip and now he acting like he Tony
I be chasing after money like I'm homeless
I had to leave that bitch alone cause she was bogus
Put a 100 on your head
Now a nigga dead
You niggas know that Young Savage will paint the city red
I don't want to do no song with these niggas cause they scared
Draco on the seat I keep that Draco on the seat
Molly, percs and weed you know these bitches like to eat
Slaughter gang, we slaughter hoes cause half these bitches freaks
All the shit I've been through man it change a young G
That's why I keep that hundred round drum around me
That's why I keep a lot of fucking guns around me
If you ain't with the gang you better not come around me
All that mother fucking leashing ain't no bum around me
You like that pillow talk but niggas shoot for fun around me

See Savage he be with them apes

Bitch I be covered in Bape
Bitch I be covered in Bape
You know I keep me a K
You know I keep me a Draco
Rap a nigga like an eggroll
Big bullets leave a big hole
I was raised by the G code
Don't bend, nigga don't fold
My uncle taught me how to scrape the bowl
And my auntie still smokin' blow
Came from nothin', nigga we was poor
Evection notices all on the door
Take out trash for some school clothes

I'm sippin' codeine all on Ocean Drive
Poppin' percocets on Rodeo Drive
Baby roll the window up and let's get high
You ain't no real nigga if you testify
I don't have to question where my niggas ride
If you gotta question, they ain't on your side
Plenty late nights I made my mama cry
Shootouts in apartments made my mama cry
Seen my niggas in a hearse, I Stevie Wonder-ed why
Retaliation, let 'em [?] like it's the Fourth JulyNow I'm on Ocean Drive sipping codeine with the top down

Smooth talkin', conversation took a nigga broad
I'm on the road doin' shows, seem like we fell apart
She think the nigga fuckin' groupies, I'm just grindin' hard
Your family said we wouldn't last but we beat the odds
Bonnie and Clyde, she was with a nigga stealin' cars
These streets so dirty I just want someone who really there
Can't fake love, just want someone who really care
Be loyal to me, want somebody I ain't gotta share
Open your eyes, baby girl, real niggas rare
All my dog ways, headin' for them in the kennel
I'ma savage to these niggas but to her I'm gentle
I'ma savage to these niggas but to her I'm gentle
I'm just sippin' on this mud, you was on my mental

If them drugs ain't in my system I can't function right

You clutchin' on yo forty
Voices in my head

One sayin' stay loyal

They really all for self
Got me thinkin' to myself
Ain't no real niggas left
Cuz all the real niggas left
They either dead or down the road
Niggas goin' out bad
They'll kill you bout a ho
Man these streets so cold, so cold
I swear these streets so cold, so cold
I pray to god that he watch my soul
And let me know whose a friend or a foe

Ain't no incidental

He pulled up to the house

Her booty nice and fat

Put a beam on that

Wash away the pain with the soda
Tryna make the work double up, I beat the bowl up
Tryna make the work double up to meet my quota
.40 on my hip, you know that chopper on my shoulder
I remember hard times when it was no love
I remember fast money and them slow bucks
I got all this gold on me like the gold rush
VVS's drippin' on me it's a hotel
I remember shoot outs niggas, broad day
Remember when I hit that nigga with the K
Niggas ain't loyal, nigga they'll betray you
Shoot 'em in the temple, give that nigga a fade
My dog got life and shit ain't been the same
All I got is money bags on my brain
Go hard in the booth and buy another chain
I do it for the money nigga, not the fame

These girls ain't even scared to give head!
[Verse 1:]
Girl, stop tryin' to be smooth
Make way for a brother to make the first move
You're tryin' to act nice and sweet
'Cause I know that you is a freak
So let a brother lick them paws
And run the tongue on the g-string draws
And tease the kitty just a little
Then stick my pole in the middle
Before I hit, let me ask
Did the dogs done hit in the path
'Cause if they ain't got they shots
Then the kitty might not get got
They say it ain't got a bad bone
In any ol 'eyes, it's gold
So girl, don't act seditty
Just give a brother some of that kitty!

[Chorus, Bridge A]Like I said, the party ain't dead,
All these chicken heads just scared!
[Verse 2:]
Kitties is cool and all that
But I like the real big cats
See, a cat got a little more strength
So they can take a little more length
You gotta feed a kitty real slow
But a cat can take a little bit mo'
So lay on down on the silk
So you can get a bowl of this milk
Then let's do it like dogs
I wanna see ya climb the walls
And once I get in them guts
I'ma do that straight cat strut
So please don't make a brother beg
To get inbetween them legs
Come on girl, have some pity
And give a brother some of that kitty![Bridge B 4x:]
True dat, true dat! True dat, true dat![Chorus][Jay-Ski:]

 "
Hip-Hop,69 Boyz,Strip Club Luv,"[69 Boyz]
I was visiting Atlanta when I met this strip dancer
now love was the question and shorty was the answer
she was dancing on the stage in her lingerie
and I think I heard teh DJ call her Sauncerea
body route around the pole on her hands and her knees
18 half black and half vietnamese
looking like she taste better than Koloa and milk
with the dirty red complexion skin smoother than silk
so young and so tender she made all me a stare
getting paid to make love to a kick in the snap
as I sat up in the cut just for waiting my chance
to solicite Sauncerea for a private dance
yo I could still remember seeing days in the made
wishing she would just hurry up and enter the stage
so this hundred I been saving for my P.I.P.
I spent slowly and Sauncerea would dance for me
with a body flowing slow like a smooth poet
it tosses gave my mind like some cool more wet
and decided we together like the birds and the bees
a match made in heaven like some O's and D's
no I never met a girl so sexy and fine
she can take a man's money especially mine
and on top of all that plunk control his mind
with the way she made her dairyiare roll and grind
plus I never thought I answer an executive club
see a sexy strip dancer and get expensive with love
cuz to love someone you don't know it really ain't smart
but in certain situations you just follow your heart
cuz in reality she's probably got a man of her own
but I could fantasize as long as I got to for a song
and 10 dollars is a small price to pay when you love
a sexy strip dancer that you met in a club

[chorus]
they turned dollars into dimes and dimes to dubs
mesmorized by your brothas when I enter the club
and though you strip for tips I place no one above
my sexy strip dancer doing strip club love
and no matter what they say I'm gonna love ya right
even if the love only last one night
she's just the cream of the crop and I place no one above
my booty shaking beauty doing strip club love[69 Boyz]
girl if your beauty was a dollar you'd be richer than Trump
cuz you better than a supersport apolloing home
if I could choose between the chance to put the ring on your hand
or a platinum presidential with baguess in the band
ain't no choice I'd rather have you than the finest of jewels
for you I travel over heart throws minus the shoes
rules there ain't none cuz I'm caught in the mix
like a herowine junky shaking needing a fix
and everytime I see you dance I get lace in my viens
an all type of loss again erasing my brain
cuz my heart says love but my mind say lust
and it's hard to decifer what emotions to trust
cuz if I trust an inner man then it may just work
but theres a 50-50 chance I could end up hurt
and I could trust in my flesh but if I move to fast
my first time could end up being my last
so I ask what kind of playa like myself fill your head with a word
or tell you anything that you ain't possibly heard
when I'm already knowing each and everynight
you hear game from the guys and girls are light
it's just a thought but maybe all my wish would thought she be bitch
cuz a girl like yourself is probably already hitched
it happen but you just dancing trying to get you a lick
or maybe you in love with the attention you get
either way Sauncerea the choice is yours to make
and everything your momma gave you girl is yours to shake
and you can shake it till you break it or the cows come home
or till all these other niggas here cash is gone
and when we finally get the chance to speak as a pair
and the beeper number is all you can spell thats cool
cuz Ima beep you like a pimp then sit by the phone
waiting for the chance to make ya all my own

Verse 1: Thrill Da Playa
Hello?
(Hey baby, what you doin'?) Playin' tetherball
And eatin' cream out the middle of some Oreos
I meant to call you back last night
But I was watchin a video of an Evander Holyfield fight
Next time you see your friend Michelle,
Tell her if she ain't fake, one of my boys wanna yell
Anyway, that's enough of that
When we gon' hook up, so I can pack the kitty-cat?
Oh, now you wanna play the switcheroo?
Well call me back when you gon' let me hit the coochy-coo
Just because I play the Babyface
Don't mean that I'm a punk that won't hang up in a lady's face
Oh, I thought you might change your mind
'Cause a fella like myself, I must admit, is hard to find
You coulda stuck with your ex-man
Just to chit-chat and talk about wedding plans
'Cause I ain't gonna talk respectfully
I talk reality, and how we can fulfill your needs sexually
The kinda stuff that'll make you wonder
And callin' me is cheaper than a 976 number
And I ain't tryin' to run game
I belong to you, so I ain't tryin' to prove a damn thing!
So we can do whatever, but now, all I
Wanna know is, when is we gon' get together?

But if we gon' be workin' out, we don't need to have too much to eat
I'm sure you need some work on your thighs
And for sure my third leg could use a little exercise
Hold on a second, hon ---
{speaking off the phone}
Man, can't you see I'm on the phone, runnin' game, tryin' to get me some?
What? If you're gonna get perverty,
Then make sure you bring back a freaky-deaky friend for me!
{he comes back on the phone}
I'm back, baby, sorry 'bout that thing
But my boys let me know I was next on the cellular game
But anyway, onto bigger things, and better things
Like kitty-cat and ding-a-ling
I really hope you're hearing me, and at the same time,
I hope you ain't gettin' the wrong idea of me
I'd love to take you to a picture show
But it's cheaper to stay home and watch it all on HBO
'Cause if we home and we take it,
We'll get the hot-buttered corn, and watch the movie naked
So baby, let's go to my room
And I hope we can get together real soonChorus, repeat till fade




 "
Hip-Hop,69 Boyz,Survival Of Da Fittest,"Verse 1
The Rottweiler:
17 years old, bold, tryin' to get my slang on
Broke as a joke, uh, tryin' my best to hang on
And if I don't, I'll be a failure
And I'll tell ya, I ain't with that, so forget that!
I get the 9 from the pawn shop layaway
Keep it in my pack and the jack men'll stay away
Fellas gettin' jealous, hate to see a nigga rise up
They tryin' to size up, but punk nigga, wise up!
I pack my 9, yeah, I'm fine, and I chill with it
Shoot 'em in a minute and just deal with it
'Cause where I'm from, you gotta buck niggas,
If you never want to be an out-of-luck nigga
I only did what I had to do
Now they're callin' me the king of the avenue
Uhh, I'm shootin' my 9 when I bail
'Cause I'd rather go to hell than jail
'Cause it's survival of the fittest

Thrill Da Playa:
Yo, it was rough from the start, son
And I knew I'd be a hustler, even when I was in kindergarten
Feelin' on the teachers and givin' 'em looks
And steady takin' all the other kids' coloring books
My momma used to try to make me study my work
But I was busy chasin' girls, gettin' under they skirts
And though she raised me the best she could,
Them whippin's ain't done me no good
And sure, I could play ball like the rest of the guys,
But yo, I always had this fear of gettin' paralyzed
And sellin' drugs at the time was the easy way
The easy work, easy women plus the easy pay
It had me feelin' like I would do whatever it takes
To have a car and a woman in a couple of states
Cause I'm a professional, and you couldn't knock it
Because I had to keep some money in my pocket
It's survival of the fittest

(Rasta chorus)Verse 2
The Rottweiler:
When I was comin' up and runnin' up,
The hoochies in my hood never took time, so I took mine
And I thought it would change, and when I got older
They just got colder, and gave me the cold shoulder
But now them hoes wanna skeeze me
Just because they see my face on TV, uhh
Them hoes be buggin'; they come a-dime-a-dozen
I'm even doin' it with my own cousin
I got hoes 'cause I'm so rich, nigga
Never get played and laid by no trick, nigga
They only speak 'cause a brother done peeped strong
I muss my hair like Fred and get the hell on
I gots no love for them hoes, and if I did it'd be a drama,
'Cause, trick, I only love my momma
And never have I sold a yard
But I'd do it if times got hard
'Cause it's survival of the fittestThrill Da Playa:
Comin' up daily, gettin' richer than rich
And all the fellas in the hood just itchin' to snitch
But I got my stuff runnin' so tight and legit
That the fans can't even make a spirit to stick
So yo, they can go and find another dealer to fade;
I got a business in my name, and my taxes is paid
They only mad 'cause they bussin' they chops
To say that I'm a millionaire because I'm cuttin' them rocks
They can't *f**k* with that, and even when they think they can,
I got a set-up so they only get the metal man!
I can't see bein' a letter to them
And locked up just because I'm doin' better than them
I tried the right way, but they kept ignorin' me
Saw opportunity, and I went for it, G!
It was smooth and the feds couldn't match me
But now that I'm legit, yo, I know they'll never catch me
It's survival of the fittest(Rasta chorus)Verse 3
The Rottweiler:
Uhhh, and ow that I'm straight with the law,
I'm makin' more money than I ever saw
But still, my 9's what I'm alive by
I'm never slippin' to be a victim of a drive-by
But it's still kind of crazy
If I spend two seconds with a girl, she's claimin' she's havin' a baby
And all my girlfriends are black, and they act rude
But if I dated another color, they'd get an attitude
And my moms ... yo, bless her soul
Alive, and bustin' her ass before 25
Got a brother in a rage, uh, she ain't a minimum woman,
So why the hell she makin' minimum wage?
I try to give her money, but she won't take it
She says she hates it; she doesn't like the way I make it
I thank the Lord I'm alive. All I have to do is survive
'Cause it's survival of the fittestThrill Da Playa:
I know the feelin', I can keep my poise
I got beepers, and all types of digital toys
And I know they think that I am sellin' dope
And wanna keep me underneath the microscope
So they can try and take what's mine
But I'll burn it to shreds, before they get one dime
And to them, it's a hurtin' fact
Because it's all insured, so yo, I'm gonna get it right back
And yeah, they lookin' like dummies
They waste they time, plus they waste they taxpayers' money
So put away your house-raidin' tactics,
Shotguns, ski-masks, and windbreaker jackets
'Cause ain't no doors gettin' kicked down
And if it is ... then I suggest you skip town
Becuase my lawyer's so good, I hope you're packed up;
In the morning, you'll be sleepin' in Alaska
It's survival of the fittest(Rasta chorus)

Verse 1
Jumped in my ride, headed for the set
You know the 'ave, where all the girls sweat
Hit the switch, turn my CD on
Toni Braxton; another sad love song
Right out my garage,
With my Rolex chain on, 'cause yo, it's time to flauge
But before I hit the scene,
I go to Johnny for shinin' so I can get my car cleaned
And got a wash with the hurry-up
Paid the man, and put a lil' somethin' in the tip-cup

It's one of my boys! Oh yeah, what a life-saver!
But then it started goin' off again
I hope it's my boy, but nope, it's my girlfirend
But I ain't gon' call her back
'Cause she'll start to trip when I tell her where I'm headed at
And I came faster than a whirl
A whole strip of cars and fly big-booty girls
Oh yeah, you can bet,
That ya' boy ain't gon' miss the set!ChorusVerse 2
Nightfall begin to slumber
Saw this real fly girl, so I gave the nymp' my beeper number
And the ol' girl was talkin' right
So I hooked up somethin' for a lil' later on tonight
Then a Bronco rolled by
And then, everybody on the set - {DO THE BUTTERFLY!}
And (?) for a minute
It was the place to be, and you can best believe I was in it
But it was time to hit the freeway
Called up B, and Daddy Black on the 3-way
To find out where the haps at
They said at the old club where we used to play craps at
True, that's how the day went
A whole lot of fun, and not one life spent
Just chillin' with the crew,
On a deep part of the avenue!

And the way you move that Puddin Tame has really turned me on
So get on the daaaaaance floor, and work it one mo' gen
Push swang that Puddin Tame until the party end
I like when you grab dem hips, and move it down real slow
Round and round with that grindin' motion, down to the floor
I know the panties you wearin' helpin' that thang look fine
It's got to be dem G-string 'cause I ain't seen no panty line
For those of y'all who don't know, just what that Puddin Tame mean,
It's that monkey, that kitty cat, that jumpin' jellybean, baby.Chorus (2x)

When he says those words that hurt you, do you read the ones I wrote you?Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?'Cause I'm not fine at allI remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

'Cause I've got a jet black heart
And there's a hurricane underneath it
Trying to keep us apart
I write with a poison pen
But these chemicals moving between us
Are the reason to start againNow I'm holding on for dear life
There's no way that we could rewind
Maybe there's nothing after midnight
That could make you stayBut now that I'm broken
And now that you know it
Caught up in a moment
Can you see inside?

'Cause I've got a jet black heart
And there's a hurricane underneath it
Trying to keep us apart
I write with a poison pen
But these chemicals moving between us
Are the reason to start againThe blood in my veins
Is made up of mistakes
Let's forget who we are
And dive into the dark
As we burst into color
Returning to life'Cause I've got a jet black heart
And there's a hurricane underneath it
Trying to keep us apart
I write with a poison pen
But these chemicals moving between us
Are the reason to start againThe blood in my veins
Is made up of mistakes
(To start again)
Let's forget who we are
And dive into the dark




 "
Pop,5 Seconds Of Summer,Catch 22,"You...
You...Wasted,
I'm playing the same parts
Where I'm chasing,
Your sick little heart
Till I'm jaded and lying on the floor
Faded,
I'm wrapped in your arms
While you're waiting
To tear me apart
With a last kiss,
You leave me wanting more

You...
You're a catch 22
Win or lose I'm screwed
I'm trapped under your spell
It saves me, breaks me
Till I fall back to you...
You're a catch 22
You're a catch 22Restless, I stay awake
With the spaces,
The thought of our hands interlacing
Is taking over me
Reckless, I'm at your front door
And I'm helpless, I'm twisted back up
In the madness, repeating history
Promise me you'll never let me leave

Pop,5 Seconds Of Summer,Heartbreak Girl,"You call me up
It's like a broken record
Saying that your heart hurts
That you'll never get over him getting over you
And you end up crying
And i end up lying...
Cause I'm just a sucker for anything that you doAnd when then phone call finally ends
You say ""Thanks for being a friend""
And I'm going in circles again and again...I dedicate this song to you
The one who never sees the truth
That I can take away you hurt, Heartbreak girl
Hold you tight straight through the daylight
I'm right here when you gonna realise
That I'm your cure, Heartbreak girl

At least that's what her parents assume
But she sneaks out the window to meet with her boyfriend

She's a good girl
A straight A-student
She's really into all that self-improvement
I swear she lives in that library
But if you ask her she'll say,""That's where you'll find me!""But if you look then you won't find her there
She may be clever but she just acts too square

You were mine for a night
I don't know how to say goodbyeMaking all our plans in the Santa Cruz sand that night
I thought I had you in the palm of my hand that night
Screaming at the top of my lungs 'til my chest felt tight
I told myself that I'm never gonna be alright

Lying here no fear of the darkness
Now I'm not happy unless, I'm close enough to you
And all these dreams I'm dreaming
Freaking me out I wish I knew the meaning
Doesn't make sense because I'm just not seeing
How I'm alive it feels like I'm not breathingBefore we started it was over
I feel our bodies getting colder
She gives me, a feeling that I can't fight

And it's the road that leads to nowhere
But all I want to do is go there
She's got me, running from the daylight
DaylightI'm not ready to start again
And you're not willing to make amends
Now the daylight's dangerous
It will turn us both to dustI'm not ready to start again
And you're not willing to make amends
Now the daylight's dangerous
And it is much too late for usBefore we started it was over
I feel our bodies getting colder
She gives me, a feeling that I can't fightAnd it's the road that leads to nowhere
But all I want to do is go there
She's got me, running from the daylight

And it's the road that leads to nowhere

And the shining as we fade into the nightShe sleeps alone
My heart wants to come home
I wish I was, I wish I wasShe sleeps alone
My heart wants to come home
I wish I was, I wish I was
Beside you
She lies awake
Trying to find the words to say
I wish I was, I wish I was
Beside youBeside you
Beside you
Beside youShe sleeps alone
My heart wants to come home
I wish I was, I wish I was 




 "
Pop,5 Seconds Of Summer,Permanent Vacation,"You say that I'm too complicated.
Hung up and miseducated.
Well I say 9 to 5 is overrated,
and we all fall down.I can't sleep cause my mind keeps racing.
And my chest hurts cause my heart keeps breaking.
I'm so numb and I can't stop shaking,
and we all fall down.Frustration, desperation.
You say you need some kinda medication.
Situation, no motivation.
Desperation, permanent vacation.

Pop,5 Seconds Of Summer,Castaway,"Young love, close the chapter, there's no ""ever after""
Fell fast, ended faster, yeah
Late night conversations, let to complications
Now my heart is in my hands
Cause you walked out and left me stranded
Nothing left but picture framesAnd I just keep on asking myself
How'd we drift so far away from where we left off yesterday?
I'm lonely like a castawayHeartbreak that I can't escape, a sinking ship I'll never save
I'm lonely like a castaway
All your screaming whispers, slip right through my fingers
But these memories linger on
Eyes closed, all I see is good times disappearing
And I'm trying to hold on

I don't recall a single word
You hit me faster than I hurt
Inside my headAnd now I'm shaking, wearing thin
I've always wondered where you've beenTell me if you wanted it at all
I got a long term plan with short term fixes
And a wasted heart that just eclipses
And I push my luck and trust the dust enough
That's the story of another us
One last ditch and new beginnings
So take this heart put yourself in it
This surprise ending I'm depending on

'Cause I've been talking to my friends

It's something I don't understand

I need somebody and always
This sick strange darkness
Come creeping on so haunting every time
And as I stared I counted
The Webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight
Don't waste your time on me you're alreadyThe voice inside my head
I miss you, I miss you Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head I miss you, I miss you




 "
Pop,5 Seconds Of Summer,Waste The Night,"Ahh Ahh
I need your love, need your loveTaste in your tongue,(ohh) the smoke in your lungs(ahh)
And I need your love, and I need your love(ahh)
The salt on your skin is pulling me in(ahh)
And I need your love, and I need your loveI don't wanna say goodbye to another night
And watch you walk away
I don't wanna let it burn in the city lights
And make the same mistakesThis time
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste the night
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it

And in the aftermath
You cannot take it back
Your point of view is everything
That you're making
Rude awakening
Hate to be the one to tell you so
I thought that you should know
Cause that's what I'm here for
Told you I'd never goAnd when the morning comes
You know I'll still be here

Whatever things that come
Through the rain
And the sunshine and the pain
We'll look back and smile

When the song is sung

Hey yo, hey yo, communication is broken, hit a wall
By the time we get out of line it's all over for composure
Hey yo, hey yo, do you hear what I'm saying?
Is our mind even open at all?Has the world ever granted you anything that you wish for?
Has your soul felt uncertain on a future outside your door?
Let the moments come, let go and let go and let go until it's all gone
Has the world ever granted you anything that you wish for?

Rock,311,Two Drops In The Ocean,"Thinking of you
It all comes in view
I believe we came from the same cloud
Two drops in the ocean
Tell me again
The story of when we
We will be together one day...We're two of a kind
Forever we've been combined
Though the current will pull us apart
Two drops in the ocean
You are part of me
The other side of the sea
And we will be together one day...

Hey hey
What can i say?
I swim your way
Though the tide pull us away
I ask you
What you gonna do?
Oceans apart
But I know no one else will do
Two drops in the ocean
Just go with the motion dearWe'll meet again
From two rivers that dealt on two shore
Two drops in the oceanFall into me
Dissolve in the sea
The boundaries between, they are nothing
But love we have, the only real thing.yeah

There is a stone wall
Around your heart
Nothin left now to do but to start
Chippin away

Until we see it break apart
Hear me talkin 'bout
Let it be known, it can be done
Bit by bit and one by one
If the two of us try from both the two sides
Until we see the sun
You're phenomenalTwo drops in the ocean
Just go with the motion.A lot of fish in the sea.

You're somethin' of a different kind

And in my Continental you know that shit's booming
With the diamond in the back suicide doors

Another tale of ordinary madness
The girl who gave you her sex I heard was homeless say
All I really wanna is to feel nirvana
Won't you take me tonight and we just might find
A bottle of wine and feel our nasty nature
Your toung lickin' up my tounge
Your radio pickin' up a smokey jazz love song
Madness becomes you even though your
Livin' life it's hard to exist when you're tempted
By flesh you wanna bust through
Beautiful legs in the bar there is poetry
She bends and suspends and her ass
Is a marvelous thing
A dance dancin' at a club the Hereafter
Who can't really dance but that doesn't really matter
And she won't hear applause
Cus your drunk and lost
All light is gone
Your arms spread like a cross
And you're dreaming that the world
Will soon fall apart
Topless firl in your gaze
Which is hazy
Takes your dollar
In the gutter without cigarettes
Or wine your hungover
I was warned of your normal
Behaviour and felt
My life was too short to
Consider your wack self
It's like this when you dip down
And you are boxin'
Reeling against the ropes and you
Face some young Mexican
Your scrappin' your kneck gets
Snapped back your eyes have bled
Your thinking' about a comeback
But your takin' it to the head
You little bastard
Better watch you back
Cuz we're after
Your punk ass by God we're gonna jack it
You're played out and small time
And your show is over
You're 'bout as lucky as a three leaf clover
And your older ho bag sceezer
In her droopy saggy skin
Who thoughtshe was a model
But in truth a never-has-been
You both are fools
You and your cheap rooms too
The cigar biting your lips the way love use to

And if I'm feelin' mean I'm gonna clutch my fist
Now when I say mean, I mean I'm gonna rock it

When I'm on I'm gone, I hear the beat that spawns
The way we freak it, and we kick up a storm
The day we turn to pop the show will stop, so
Feel the beat and get lost, now
Back to part two, the hard way we play
Sublime on time, to all the fans I'm SA
And if you don't know I say check the show
Do what you got to on the dance flo'
Some say the style is wack but I say fuck that
Get the hell back and watch us rock the set
We cast the mold, bust it cold explode
Mega-trendsetters known around the globe
Friends takin' you where you never been
We done what we wanted craftin' poems
You can rock, there is a glow around you
Lose control, holmes, just like we do
Hard to obtain, brotha, what's my name?
Mad to find unlike ya' mama and your masquerade
I drive a Mach-1, no dashboard Jesus

Notice what I don't do when stress steps to me
Whatever your complaint, so sue me

Gotta do what I gotta do to get the people glowin'
So let everybody gather, the more the better
I represent the traveler, him he's a shredderAt ease with yourself and don't try to please me

On the town one light I'm a glow worm
For several hours wiggle jiggle like I'm a huge sperm
Can't appreciate a brother's love of funky music
You think I'm a silly rabbit 'cuz my style has tricks

(Chorus)Now those sleepless nights thoughts just cloud up my brain
Feeling helpless repeating the same old memories of pain and I wish it would rain, yo
Gimme starlit skies fro dreamland
I know it's really smaller than it seems
But when the pressure gets under my skin
I just wanna get out and scream in the wind, yo
The world we're livin in is complicated
The streets that we walk on are dark and jaded
A wandering soul that's filled with hatred
In it is poison the youth is tainted
Social engineering keeps us seperated
Media control is highly overrated
Ignorance is bliss to those uneducated
Listen to the message cuz it's time we faced it(Chorus)

I'm controller of my destination
Gotta change my mind to help me break away
The sun creeps over the hillside to shed this light
No man could ever take away
I guess that's life you see a new side from the norm
A new direction and meaning to the form
And the calm in the eye of the storm, yo
Show me a desert that can never be drenched
I'll show you a thirst that can never be quenched
Temptation chronicles, the story of my life
Been spent on a dose of balancing strife
Inspiration it comes and goes
You can bet when it hits I'm on the phone
Singing to my voicemail trying to get it down
In a sensation of shape shifting sound
You're telling fables to cover up your foibles
From overindulgence on things you find enjoyable
Designed to take my mind away from truth
Try to make me play the sleuth
They want you to think someone's watching you
So they can make up a set of rules for you
I'm just trying to find a path that I can stomach
Just trying to make some sense out from it
Don't stop what you got
Don't stop til you find the sweet spot(Chorus)

That weighs two hundred tons
I'd like to drop it on you

I jump into the valley of the far from mundane
my knees buckle a chuckle chuckle

distract the facts ma'am, that's the plan now
where you work, where you lurk, what you search
climb too much get off of that perch
virtual reality your nightmare
on the grid, kid, getting nowhere
get ahead, leave behind
lose your mind find in time
a nowhere rhymeChemicals up in the atmosphere

buried in the headlines disappear

you dream but I know you're awake
explaining a nightmare you couldn't shake

regardless of what cards get played

too calm to get upset by somebody's notionFuture makers
organ takers
a non-human intelligence is guiding
worlds colliding
far away star system
I string DNA where I need 'emWhat we gonna get with a zero field
gotta have the one to make it real
I tell ya that more will be revealed
the mystery don't bother me
everyday masquerade
there's always too many plans we laid
keep going faster down the grade we madeWe're breaking away from the past
reaching a new plane at last
regardless of what cards get played
no one can keep you afraidWe're always beginning
as sure as we're spinning
for it's never ending from here

I am sorry I'm not sorry
hate me later

Black Eyed Peas they comin' full range and

Roni Size he's comin' full range
The one Mr. Vegas you know it ain't easyA warning to the crews out there who think they're hot
If you're not original I guess you will get shot
Down by the kids neglectin' your art, the stuff you did
Eventually it get so bad puts you to bed
Cuz when the lightning flashes sweet electricity
All the world then stands revealed with the clarity
Of raw voltage, briefly we see and the hope is
You'll be able to tell just what dope isCome original you got to come original

Funk slap bass mixed with the dancehall and
Hip-hop beats and punk guitar and
Deadly on the mic is the one SA
The name is 311 and you know it ain't easyThis is not a test there's no time to mope
How you gonna cope with the radioactive isotope
And boss DJ illness upon you now quickly
Infecting you fast upon the airwaves
This message brought to you by the so large system
Activate and attune yourself with mediation
And green plants they've got mad life they're sentient
They're beautiful as you and they like to danceEverything we do we gotta come original
Put your hand up in the air and prepare for battle
Sit upon the rhythm like a tire upon a rim
We do it non-stop and then we do it again
Some of them whine and some of them bitch
They can not do it never switch
Comin' up from the heart and
Delivered with a wild pitch
Sit up on top the rhythm like a wild stallion
This is the ruling systemCome original you got to come original
All entertainers come original
You got to come original you got to come original
All entertainters come original
You got to come original you got to come original
All entertainers come original
You got to come original you got to come original

 "
Rock,311,Creatures (For A While),"My name is Volatile
I've been this way a long while
I'd surely like to rest
But the energy gets the best of me
It's been a wild ride
I wouldn't change a minute
I can't slow down inside
Guess that's why I live itThe years of mischief
followed by the weeks of thrift
I land on earth's hard face
No legs could keep that pace
And through the rest I siftIs there ever a time
When the state of sleeping
Willingly leaves my mind

Highly frustrated wanna feel elated
Come Monday morn you feel checkmated
You can be uncool and become the rule
Exceptions were made to drownI'm not use to it, you'd think I'd be by now
The ins, the outs the ups and the downsI wanna make a mess
I wanna blow off stress
I wanna stoke the fire
Just creatures for a whileI wanna make a mess
I wanna blow off stress
I wanna stoke the fire
Just creatures, just creaturesIt comes and goes it comes and goes
Sometimes I go a little crazy
Sometimes I go a little crazy just like you I do

I know what you where gonna say
But were afraid to cause dismay
You're lyrics switched around
The mixture watered down
And now a pointless displayIts something one won't understand
Unless they're in it with me hand and handDon't buy the fear don't buy that my dear
The things you love you must keep near and
Carry on and on and you won't feel withdrawn
Even if you are coming downSometimes it's wearable sometimes its bearable
I careen towards balance til' the glass is fullI wanna make a mess
I wanna blow off stress
I wanna stoke the fire
Just creatures for a whileI wanna make a mess
I wanna blow off stress
I wanna stoke the fire
Just creatures, just creaturesIt comes and goes it comes and goes
Sometimes
Sometimes I get a little out there
Sometimes I go off
Sometimes just like youI go a little crazy
Sometimes I go a little crazy just
Like you I do
Sometimes I go a little crazy
Sometimes I go a little crazy just like you I do

Not the possums playing dead messing with my head

For years again I tell you the same, ooh, ooh oooGone already to the bored of it all type, lingo
That I'm seein every single night I'm out
Bustin' head for it but yours gets busted right back
Lip split and, I messed up but I got back tryin'Don't bother lying 'bout constant disappointment
But the fun is in the hunt so quit actin' on a frontYou're unmotivated, You're sort of faded
But the remedy is not so get on with what you gotRemember ""Lady of Guadalupe"" The times my mother made mole
After mass we would get home, The girls running to the phone
And I'm in my bedroom the 45 on my record player
Was ""We're In This Love Together""

At the time I never realized how songs haunted
The ones that I heard I played because I wanted
Drawing on my wall from time to time coolin'
Making creatures come alive with no schoolin'When I'm on the microphone
The method that I make is much patience
The method that I make is much patience
I wait for the beat and then I make senseI'm comin' in hot forgot, you definitely got no clue
I'm comin' in hot you got, you definitely got so rude
Boy actin' coy but you got nuts like Almond Joy
I tell ya this is a tributeNo one looks as foolish as the excitable ones
But then again there's no one has as much fun
""X"" amount of action, ""X"" amount of games
For years again I tell you the same, ooh, ooh ooo

Once I met a man who made nearly no mistakes
He would never bet on a longshot and he'd never bet on a break and
He's condescending and talks gossip galore
But the dude was definitely such a boreHear me now I messed up but I got back trying
Don't bother lying 'bout constant disappointment
But the fun is in the hunt so quit actin' on a frontYeah, unmotivated you're sort faded
But the real man is not the one hiding behind the gunshot, boom!Time travelin' through my memory
There's a younger Doug gazin' at the galaxy
Space trippin' vato of the stars
Searchin' for UFO's from Neptune and MarsOde to an alien I know you're out there
Cosmic lonely heart tell me if you care
I'm listening for your sound, here on the ground
I'm listening for your sound, here on the groundWhen I'm on the microphone
The method that I make is much patience
The method that I make is much patience
I wait for the beat and then I make senseI'm comin' in hot forgot you definitely got no clue
I'm comin' in hot you got you definitely got so rude
Boy actin' coy you got nuts like Almond Joy
I tell ya this is a tributeI'm vexing many mofos but I'm wishing you the best
I keep 'bout half my lyrics and I throw out the rest
Cause fly on by, you can if you want to
The method that makes sense is patience

We're going stronger, take it in along the way
I got this super OG and it goes crazy
It's an extension, this reach is so far away
Now we just break it on down, heyStand up and create could be on anything that we set our mind
United by fire to be undefined
Working all the time and gonna be hard because we came to play
That's because you wouldn't have it any other way
The reaches all the reaches of the intake of mind
I find a place where I can go where no one ever will find
I make a perfect exchange, I make it kind acting strange
Sometimes the places that I go make people think I'm deranged
If there's a reason that you're holding up the wall let it fall
I think it's treason when I'm sick of people throwing it all
I let them all just fly by with a quick wink to the eye
I think you all better quick just listen in your ride

Stand undefeated in anything that we set
Our mind united by fire to be undefined
It's an extension, this reach is so far away

Something about that decade they can't give a day
What do you play?
Thinking about the people we're jumping the two or three
We're keeping it dry till we goodbye the limits of the weight, heyIf there is a spirit and it's making our way
Seeing all the people traffic to it and they come around, they come around and
You look and bear it cause there's no other way
And so they step into the ground, they've all been getting down

First to flow Nickel my brother, so wise
And then I rise
Here's an ill kid pimpin' cuz he is so slick
Step's from darkness his body electric
A drone buzzes the air a cracklin' tone
Then boomin' like thunder in a cosmic jungle
Deathe defyin; like Knievel he weeble
Words that will wobble awkward and evil
Cuz he flow and rock the hardest of the crowds
A marvel pow how you like me now
I've returned the kiss of death the last Damien
From the abyss fresh eternal alien
Now famished from pathless way I ma, do damage
To the wack MC's I know you can't stand this
Right about now get down I'm the annihilator

You see it all so clearly
There's nowhere on Earth to be

Oh bake it like a snowflake, drink the water it becomes

Mixing all the elements with alien technology
A secret message hidden in this tune

Rock,311,Silver,"Don't fear mere words cuz if it takes a word ruin ya
You should have already hard you're finished through and soon ya
See that stifling sentences is so much more suspicious
Much worse could come of that so much more delicious
To the dastardly bastardly plans of little mice and men
Ugly rears its head and speaks from now and then
People love to disagree so avoid the endless bout make no attempt
To try and suss the stupid out
But of the racist institutions simple minds belong
Not happy just being human, no wish to get along
Little people need exclusions sucker groups to throng
It makes them feel special it makes them feel strong
Now I got a click but it's more like a family
Not an ethnic trip more like an ethic see
I write the rhyme today tell it to you later
Whether were coming in wack or what it's a waste to be a hater

Dropping the bomb and all that is left is the smokin'
Cloakin' chokin; the lyrics are spoken
Infrared vision scopin' condition

You juice your fucking friends like Dracula
But when we kick you out you're just brokula
You left a big surprise from Pacific Bell
Called all your relatives and your friends in Hell
Now let me tell you something you fucking piece of shit
You'll never have no money, now tell me was it worth it?
You leave a trail of lies that's why you keep moving
We won't come after you we'd only end up provin
In the end revenge send ends to the defendant
I know that statement's true I wear it like a pendant
I know you'll hear this song so I think it's funny
The name is theif or trust and money.Like Captain Picard we come hard in light years
Our star has long bust but now reappears
In your sky at night rising and immense
Yes you see ourselves in the shine of it
And so passing under the dome of the great sky
Beware we are the stars holmes that you ruled by
Where death reborn into the world is a gift
So the future with no voice of its own will upliftAll is gone
All is calm y'allSet wrecked in L.A.
In the Wetlands of New York
Atlanta and Phoenix

You know it's gonna be a new thing
Don't be afraid
In your heart you'll find a way
You wanna get your kicks
You're just plain six
Back at the beach Big Z could teach
All the little ones that you could reach
Make it back home, a cool head wind
In front of my mirror, pretend i was him
Stayin' up late didn't wanna go to bed
Watchin' Big Z remained in my head
It came with the surf it came with a bang
And all acros the board my friends felt the same

Something you might like now
All-star bound
Yeah your so sound
Cool as the blue water all around
From a force field flashing
Aliens are sending
Black evolutions of love you are hearing
The dark supernatural is the world we call
Our own home lightning in the mind comes out in song
But we're wild they say never trust us we're shady
In lieu of the crew your into we are baby
Cuz music will be coming out the words we speak
We erect breakbeats shatter wax still on the platter
Our shit is badder we come fly then we scatter
Cuz we deep and we solid yeah we hear ya holler

Electricity running through is all that feels good
Sometimes the only thing that really ever could
Feed that hunger I crave it I love it I gave it
I shove it in a battery and save it for later
A waiter in the Dorothy C. Pavilion in '89
I met some wierdos and had myself a real good time
Downtown L.A. is a soul graveyard
Where you got to be hard or get jacked
It lacked a certain sense of something
Something basic no karm in he least I broke east
You know I had to face itI guess I flaked but it was no mistake because
311's got the boomMy mic check is giving me
Electric company
I can't see the high wide sky
Or stars above me
Are you a flower
Or more like a high rise tower
If so the soul of sweet delight
On you will shower
There's a place for us they say is somewhere
Not a dream but a place and you will be there
Your slippin' but content because your spirit
And hills are alive with the sound of musicPeople never see the whole trip of life man
Grab knowledge and all you do is syph

How do I keep it?
How do I keep it here?'Cause I wanna get high
But you're keeping me low
I don't got time to waste or time to kill
I've had too much to think
I wanna get high
But you're taking me down down down
Don't got time to waste or time to kill
I've had too much to thinkIlluminate the shadow
And try to keep the light within (keep the light within)
Avoid another battle

'Cause I wanna get high
But you're keeping me low
I don't got time to waste or time to kill
I've had too much to think
I wanna get high (I wanna get high)
But you're taking me down down down
Don't got time to waste or time to kill
I've had too much to thinkOh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I've had too much to thinkAs I walk through the valley of the shadow of LA
See the faces of the people as they run away
It's a permanent made distraction, the modern reaction
The people don't have to feel the dissatisfaction
It's a slow journey up but a quick ride on down
And nobody here knowing their way around
From the top of the world every which way is down
And who's gonna take the crown?'Cause I wanna get high (I wanna get high)
But you're keeping me low (But you're keeping me low)
I don't got time to waste or time to kill
I've had too much to think
I wanna get high (I wanna get high)
But you're taking me down down down
Don't got time to waste or time to kill
I've had too much to thinkOh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I've had too much to think

Rock,311,From Chaos,"From chaos comes clarity, I tell ya
What you appear to be, you ought to know
Glycerin tears don't fool me, I tell ya
Delusions plaguing everybodyMakin that hybrid music back in '90 now it's on ya
I hear we were the model for the band you front we spawned ya
Finding it hard to come original we warned ya
We're shakin the white boys in New York, black girls in California
We come through hip-hop drum-n-bass and dancehall rhythms
You want our beats and lyrics you want to get them
Watchin you sink into the depths of opportunism
Missing the point, music's about love not pessimism
I'm SA moving supreme and on my team
I rock the mic with a sweet lean
And you know that stated as a fact the only DJ MC gettin down like that
Metaphorically we are the chief of police you're rock n' roll
And we're positive you stole more than just the radio
Now it's 2-1 and we are back in control
The jammies are coming, people succumbing cuz we got the soulEveryone tends to forget upon re-entry
Orbiting space quantum saints we're the only
Beginning from a planet so naturally
Gifted in the heart lies our technology
It's only right, right
Entering in a space of pure delight, light
Next contestant on this jam is, tight
Feels spontaneous you'll improvise, vise

If dealing with punks was school, I'd have a Harvard degree
You can't make me hate you no matter how punk you act
No matter what you do I don't react
I'm a perfect example of not giving a f--k
About the catty rude people that just suck
What do you know all of the sudden, uh I usurp you
Look it up in the dictionary to find out what I do

Count me in, if you're in, I'm in

You know I'm with you, count me in, If you do I doMany years together tell me something is right
Wake up every morning and the feeling is nice
We're not living the dream, we're living the life
Hold to the source well, hold me tightGuarding the flame before it goes out
And it will go out that is no doubt
The circle of everything is what it's about

There comes a day when you let THINGS go
There comes a time to a rock showYou know the time that you feel

Forward we crawl
Backwards we fall
Through the Ebb and the Flow
Living within a dream
Wading through the stream
Beyond the Ebb and FlowUp late to earn the proceeds
All stressed out working til your eyes bleed
Overtime to buy things we don't needYour always on the go
And you're thirty thirty
Gotta make the ends
And get dirty dirty
Will it ever stop
Will it ever end

The reality of this
Is you go loco loco
And too much of this way
And you'll go postal postal
Happens all the time get in line
And go comatoseThe moms and pops
Have all closed up shop
And who can blame them
I don't know anyone
The kids just hide
Scared to go outside
And just who can blame themAt times it seems unreal
We can see but we can't feel
And no one's at the wheel
Born here all alone
Growing old with hearts of stone
The lights are on
But no one's homeForward we crawl
Backwards we fall
Through the Ebb and the Flow
Living within a dream
Wading through the stream
Beyond the Ebb and FlowImages we have made
Cross and fade

Now I'll never be the same
No one can ever see
What that slinky girl means to meSo I'll just pretend
But I feel likeMackadocious she's sweet and precocious
She's the one girl that I just dig, love, yes I'm not above this
You think that's wack then bro you lack
You bore me that macho crap makes me snore, see, me,

Made our way blindly for way too longOnly thing to stop us or cutting us off of
The road I've been told that ends in a drop off
The universe explodes, new galaxies pop up
New galaxies pop upLow on gas, going fast in the passing lane
All the light in the tunnel was an oncoming train
Out of sight, out of mind, now I'm stuck in a bind
That was the end of the lineLick shot, king of the block
It's going down another hard knock
That's all you've got
We'll turn it up in the mix
They'll hear it loud in the sticks
Relay the message from the downtowns
With loud sounds we expound
It will be too late

Driven out by the fire that drives the human race

Bodies cloven
Light of daybreak blinded next exit
The wild darkness forming inside it

Are rumbling through this cursed universe where death is birth
Think not but what your manifest is worth
Giving up a verse the curse occurs a thirst
To burst first breaking through the center of the universe
Slamming down on the lingo flow so jam to the bumrush single
Long ago has been become now when you find out there's no break
In the rhythm. Black anima makes my stamina stand alone disown the cinema farewell to posing decades dozing comin up the steps of the new

Rock,311,Paradise,"Everything you do, it comes back to you
Whatever it may be
If it isn't one thing, rest assured that something
Will come back and pay you for your deed
A shortcut's a self-defeating means, if you cannot do it clean
You'll never reach your reward
(You'll never reach your reward)
And when the day is done, what you receive is the sum
Of what you took out, from what you put inTimes deep in a dream seems a veiled realm
Shadows what I think and feel is real
Times in our tribe feel the vibe when we thrive
I have no fear of death and no fear of life

I can't forget you and our version of Paradise
I can't forget you and our version of ParadiseEverything you do, it comes back to you
Whatever it may be (Whatever it may be)
What you did as a devil or what you did as an angel
The favor returns itself somehow
If you take my money I'll buy you a drink and you'll see
That no one rides for free
(No one) No oneAfraid of what I said then your mind is stricken
I'm wearing my heart sleeveless and I'm always up for kickin'
This is my favorite city pity everywhere the enemy
From the beginning serious history
Nothing's ever given
No one rides for free
From the beginning radiant energy's I know
music's what I need to keep my sanity

I say we fear no evolution stand up musical revolution
Follow me now when I say we can never stop and we never give
Cuz this is how we breathe and live
Some of them whine and some of them bitch
They cannot do it we never switch
We do it for ourselves, we do it for you
If you don't like it well - I hope you do
I've got to be honest
(I've got to be honest)
I've got to be honestI can't forget you and our version of Paradise
I can't forget you and our version of Paradise
I can't forget you and our version of Paradise
I can't forget you and our version of Paradise

Rock,311,Solar Flare,"Not the back of a gentle mother
I do like a manhole cover
It keeps on pounding my head
We'll order water
Torture sauce and economics
Every day just more comics
In a pissing contest
That started out with atomic bombs
Mom will they drop the bomb
Will they think about their children's children
Be a forwardless mess and this
No one to call
You can't make them stall
I want to feed them to each other
Cause I'm sick of them all

How can't you see something's missing
Is anyone listening
We're shooting up flares
Does anyone careThey got this world locked down bound and gagged
From the reds in Pine Ridge to that land in BagdadWhen did our leaders
Become bottom feeders
We're shooting up flares
Does anyone careThey got this world locked down bound and gagged
With constant fear and paranoia toxins in our headIt's just something they know how to do
How to make everyone feel uncalm
The masses just take it while they turn the screws
Bring to a boil, add oil, then bomb
It's just something that we got to fight
How to make everyone feel uncalm
Keep us distracted with?

Porno shows, MTV hoes, and all the radio
It's the same fucking song
That's just the way it goes
Cold turkey world to democracy's girls
From the rules of engagements sweet heart
This is the worldHow can so many sit silent
Enough to the violence
We're shooting up flares
Does anyone careThey got this world locked down bound and gagged
The Botox, Barbie dolls, and magazine adsIt's just something they know how to do
How to make everyone feel uncalm
The masses just take it while they turn the screws
Bring to a boil, add oil, then bomb
Embodying all that we know to be wrong
How to make everyone feel uncalm
When a war chant becomes a popular song




 "
Rock,311,Give Me A Call,"Ooh you draw such pictures in my head
Ooh with so few words I know what you saidUntil the time comes
To carry the one
Make that dream real
And be sure it stays done
So let that thought
Bloom in your mind
A vision that's caught
Never left behind

You should just give me a call
You should just give me a callI think about you much more than I should
Now there's a structure nothing had once stood
No more bluffing it's cards on the table time
What it must be we will take it as a signSo just give me a call
So just give me a callSunset and my love left me
winter and I'm so far
In darkness will it lead me
where the meanings areI miss and think of you often
no flowers I forgot them
the weather's the same
nothing happens
no love's a hard lesson

patience and years will refashion
what hours will undo
and circles not yet quite circles
somehow close true
I keep on hearing all the things that you said
I keep on feeling you go straight to my head
No more bluffing it's cards on the table time
What it must be we will take it as a signSo just give me a call
So just give me a callI call you up but you won't talk to me
No space for words there's just no room
I drift away but you pull me in
I'm the ocean youre the moonOoh how do I know if it's just me
Sometimes I think that it must be
You gotta know you can trust meI think about you much more than I should
Now there's a structure nothing had once stood
No more bluffing it's cards on the table time
What it must be we will take it as a signSo just give me a call
So just give me a call
So just give me a call
So just give me a call

Rock,311,8:16 A.m.,"Stranger flowers yet
There will never come a day that I will ever regret
The hours days years and the minutes
The joy, the pain, the sunshine and rain in itThe drives on the coast to nowhere
Nothing to say just sit and stare
Nothing like the comfort of a silence that's comfortable
Not talking small, just skip the bullThen I find myself in servility
Didn't think that was my ability
I go a yard and a mile to make you smile
But then I'm happy seeI got so many ways to make your gaze elliptical
Got a ways to go future's so critical
And I'm glad just another many things we've had

If it's 8: 16 A.M. will you wake up to me?
First thing that you see
My eyes open, I'm just hopin'
You feel the same as me
Day starts carefullyOn the sidewalk with the dog
You're right, last night I was a hog
Come on I'm sorry, it's 73 degrees
January easily glides, easily glidesStranger flowers still
If you're gonna wanna go another day I will
Like this make it a deal, sealed with a kiss
Sealed with a feel of impermanent blissToday my love we shall let the world slide
Turn off the ringer and just glide
For we will never be younger again
Than what do you see

Holiday on radio
Billie knows that is the way to go
The way to goA place where we both can spend out saved time
Not collecting interest
Maybe the same reason we always find ourselves home bound
I've got to do some homework
The leave response we want to leave Wisconsin
For a new life a new trailer with an antenna and a porch
Of course we'll bring the dog




 "
Rock,311,Five of Everything,"No matter what I try there's no room in my mind
No way to go round that, that's just the way it is must I remind
I don't pick up the phone but you still try to call
There's nothing left to say you've already gotta know we've said it allThe story never ends, in search of something
But once we arrive it all starts again
Reaching for higher ground, the river's rising
It keeps on flowing forever no matter what we have foundSometimes it seems insane
To just keep pressing on
As if it will put out the flame
But still the thirst remains
Drink another drink
And somehow I still feel the same

Step off, head out, take flight, and just run
Got five of everything but I just need one
My brain telling me what I want, I need
Got five of everything but I still proceedHelp me fill up this hole
It's gaping and out of control
It feels like I'm losing touch and it's taking its toll
When this wall isn't moving
State of things not improving
And no satisfaction in the distraction of the daySometimes it seems insane
To just keep pressing on
As if it will put out the flame
But still the thirst remains
Drink another drink
And somehow I still feel the same

Step off, head out, take flight, and just run
Got five of everything but I just need one
My brain telling me what I want, I need
Got five of everything but I still proceedLiving in this culture can be a drag
It's just a commercial what we have
A one track mind we grab, grab, grab
We're past being crazy, call us mad
Gone is the golden egg and the goose
And the bullshit of all hell breaking loose
We gotta hit the boost
Sip on the thick juice
Disregard the bad cards
And wake the truthStep off, head out, take flight, and just run
Got five of everything but I just need one
My brain telling me what I want, I need
Got five of everything but I still proceedThe story never ends, in search of something
But once we arrive it all starts again
Reaching for higher ground, the river's rising
It keeps on flowing forever

told on the down-low

maybe its better to fight, one never ever knows

Will fuck you up
when you least expect it
you think you're moving closer
when suddenly you wrecked it
but all the same, the pain gains wisdom
as if you ain't had enough then you're in some
prison of your own creation
mental dilation
look at what your facin' placin'
blame in every direction (what?)
but in the end it's your own infection, (di?)There's no way to avoid listening
you'll always end up listening
here's hoping the voices aren't too unkind
here's hoping the voices are benign
it's easier when you hear it
there's no reason to fear it

keep comin' back to remind you, for eternity
of when you gave up the fightThere's no way to avoid listening

Rock,311,Offbeat Bare-ass,"Any different people can apply to drop the funk
It's not a country club review board steady talkin junk
Many people would have it others go put and grab it
Some trip over toots and say fuck it I'm sunk
I put it in a limerick and kick the slick nick verbs
I am the one who scores the herb
When we're on the road P-Nut rolls it up
Throw me a joint on stage what's up
I will tell a cop that I know my fucking rights
And we can match wits all night for real
He said if I had nothing to hide
Then of course I wouldn't mind if he looked through our ride
Uh, no I'd really rather you didn't
And no we don't have guns hidden
We stood there for a while continue to decline
Firmly, I didn't lose my mind
I didn't let him break me he's just another human
Not a bit of shame in what we were doin' that day
He couldn't make us stay
We had our shit together
It don't matter whether
We sport the dread locks or a shaved head
Or if we have a sticker from the dead
I said a better verse rehearsed about the roughneck curse
Last week I keep an even keel and bow in place
And face the music every minute

Never could see my homey comin' till he passed
Funky gas by my way all the day I couldn't laugh
Oh by now I'm chill with it
Bare ass in my face I'm ok but Chad's like ""Uh-uh no he isn't""
So I proceed to hear him get loose with the
Fartin' all over my face sometimes my tummy
He fucked with my flow although I thought it funny
I probably wouldn't care if I smoked more kind bud
But that wouldn't do me shit cuz then he'd fuck me more up
Crazy ill and chillin' rude but I'ze a real cool dude
He didn't believe the day would come when he would get his top
But then one day right in front of his face I got him
He looked over said ""God damn get me some water""
The one time I hadn't wasted till I got mine
Smeared his nose with my armpit funk slime
So you get it the picture just how sick we were then
But before I jet ""Hey yo Chad sniff my finger man""

High jump the slump open up fot eh Revy Horton Heat
Sweet what am I displayin' forgot what I was saying
I know I must be laying a pipe you got a gripe
With the way I get high

Mandatory sentence for a crime with no victim
When everyone knows jail terms should be picked in
Order of the pain that they cause
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law
Until you violate the rights of another
Respect the space of your sister and your brother
The war on drugs may be well intentioned
But it falls fucking flat when you stop and mention
The overcrowded prisons where a rapists gets paroled

Mornings we all rise to wireless Verdi cries.
I'm hearing opera through the door.
The souls of men and women, impassioned all.
Their voices climb and fall; battle trumpets call.
I fill the bath and climb inside, singing.He will not touch their pastry
but every day they bring him more.
Gold from the breakfast tray, I steal them all away
and then go and eat them on the shore.I draw a jackal-headed woman in the sand,
sing of a lover's fate sealed by jealous hate
then wash my hand in the sea.
With just three days more I'd have just about learned the entire score to Aida.

What could be the awful crime
He could do at so young an age?
If I'm the only witness to your madness
Offer me some words to balance
Out what I see and what I hearAll these cold and rude
Things that you do
I suppose you do
Because he belongs to you
And instead of love
And the feel of warmth
You've given him these cuts
And sores that don't heal with time or his ageAnd I want to say, ""Hi""

There is a world outside of this room and when you meet it promise me
you won't meet it with your gun taking aim.

Lone young man takes a seat.
And by the rhythm of the rails, reading all his mother's mail from a city boy in a jungle town postmarked Saigon.
He'll go live his mother's dream, join the slowest parade he'll ever see.

He's wandering and lost until a vet in worn fatigues takes him down to where they belong.
Near a soldier, an ex-Marine with a tattooed dagger and eagle trembling, he bites his lip beside a widow breaking down.
She takes her Purple Heart, makes a fist, strikes The Wall.

He leaves the letters asking, ""Who caused my mother's tears, was it Washington or the Viet Cong?""

Black hands on white shoulders

A righteous title for the Word he heard

Though simple-minded, a crippled man, to know this man's to fear this man
To shake when he comes

and there's no complaining while he's reigning.
The lambs are bare of fleece and cold; the lion has stolen that, I'm told.
There must be some creature mighty as you are.
The lambs go hungry (not fair), the biggest portion is the lion's share.

Listen and agree, no words can shame him or tame him.
The lambs are bare of fleece and cold; the lion has stolen that, I'm told.
There must be some creature mighty as you are.
The lambs go hungry (not fair), the biggest portion is the lion's share.
There must be some creature mighty as you are, as you are.Razor claws in velvet paws, you dunce in your guarded home,
'til a stronger beast will call on you and pounce upon your throne.

Do we pay? Dearly, for the lion takes so greedily
and he knows that what he's taken, it is ours.
That's how the wealth's divided among the lambs and king of the beasts, it is so one-sided.
Until the lamb is king of the beasts we live so one-sided.

We're not as close as we could be.
Willing to grow but rains are shallow.
Barren and wind-scattered seed on stone and dry land, we will be.
Waiting for the light arisen to flood inside the prison.
And in that time kind words alone will teach us, no bitterness will reach us.

Who came building missions?
Unswerving men of the cloth who gave their lives in numbers untold so that black sheep entered the fold.
Captured like human livestock, destined for slavery.
Naked, walked to the shore where great ships moored for the hellbound journies.
Bought and sold with a hateful hate.Curiosity filled the breasts of these with some strange ecstasy.
Curiosity killed the best of these by robbing their lives of dignity.
Still they moved on and on.Calling men of adventure for a jungle bush safari.
Come conquer the, his claws and teeth.
See death in his eyes to know you're alive.
European homesteads grew up in the colonies with civilized plans for wild hinterlands, their guns and God willing.
Such a hateful hate.

Curiosity spilled the blood of these for their spotted skins and ivory.
Curiosity filled the heads of these madmen with the lies of destiny.
Curiosity spilled the blood of these, then blotted their lives from history.
Curiosity filled the heads of these, one man claimed all that he could see.
Curiosity still entices these madmen with a lusting and a greed.
Their legacy, legacy, legacy...

Rock,"10,000 Maniacs",There Are Days,"These are the days.These are days you'll remember.
Never before and never since, I promise, will the whole world be warm as this.
And as you feel it, you'll know it's true that you are blessed and lucky.
It's true that you are touched by something that will grow and bloom in you.These are days you'll remember.
When May is rushing over you with desire to be part of the miracles you see in
every hour.
You'll know it's true that you are blessed and lucky.
It's true that you are touched by something that will grow and bloom in you.These are days.

These are the days you might fill with laughter until you break.
These days you might feel a shaft of light make its way across your face.
And when you do you'll know how it was meant to be.
See the signs and know their meaning.
It's true, you'll know how it was meant to be.
Hear the signs and know they're speaking to you, to you.

on the day manolete died
teenage girls in soft white dresses
standing silent peace respecting
groups of boys held in their hands
the fragments of a shattered idol
the old men with their traditions challengedained from tearsneck neck hook
poles of wood
the picadores stood eyes ablaze
to view brutal contest

honor salute and speak
to the corner standing flag
do you remember how the days of school were
indivisible separate worlds
compare contrast
these dreams absurd
placid classroom faces
breathe in the features
of a demographics death map trilogy
children read them well
not to bury 3 of 4 sons
as the likes of chivalry
not to take 6 of 30 bills
to manufacture corpus christi
and so you think it can be so serene
history's most intolerable famine
has clutched our global tranquility
reaped the lives of children
maladies collaborate
with cyclic despair
infanticide clamors to 20 times more
in 4th and 5th Worlds
the poor have always been
beside us
amid us
death has always been
as million cease 15 million that's an annual reap
add divide multiply sum 41 thousand!

Rock,"10,000 Maniacs",On And On,"Out through the foggy window there just to see the eyes of my future children
looking back at me back through the foggy window
on and on miles pass years turn over
on and on there from that rolled down window ponies run free
cradled protectively there in the greenery somewhere I keep this picture
on and on miles pass years turn over
on and on for all the roads we've travelled
and all the bridges burned I was thinking out loud the ways
of the world that all seem so constant how few
of the lessons we really have learned.
out through the foggy window frozen in frame capturing passing pictures
life's last refrain, memories ashes scatter
on and on miles pass years turn over
on and on

You were envy, you wouldn't say
You tore heart strings that sorry dayDark light hid the tears
One for each of the years
Love has reasons, reason never knows
Time turns over, love overflowsI should have spoken sooner
On that sorry day
Your arms were openAnd I wondered why, I wondered why
Wondered why, I wondered why
Wondered why, I wondered why

Rock,"10,000 Maniacs",In The Quiet Morning,"lyrics/music - Mimi Fariña
In the quiet morning
there was much despair
and in the hours that followed
no one could repairThat poor girl
tossed by the tides of misfortune
Barely here to tell her tale
Rolled in on a sea of disaster
Rolled out on a mainline rail
She once walked tight by my side
I'm sure she walked by you
Her striding steps could not deny
Torment from a child who knew

there would be despair
and in the hour that followed
no one could repairThat poor girl
she cried out her song so loud
it was heard the whole world round
(A symphony of violence
The great southwest unbound)
In the quiet morning
there was much despair
and in the hour that followed
no one could repair

Rock,"10,000 Maniacs",Somebody's Heaven,"There like a feather you fell someone's heaven above me
floating so fickle tempting me teasing my ways
thrown from its clutches I struggle to free what escapes me
Absalom hanging like you I'm caught in between
heaven then earth then heaven between you
release me untangle my hair
Absalom hanging like you I'm caught in between
heaven then earth heaven between you
patient I wait as I hold a small feather
that floated from somebody's heaven.

Rock,"10,000 Maniacs",Cabaret,"Shards of glass cut through my gaze
broken streamers hanging at my legs
drunk and giddy full of fate
at the cabaret
smokey stares from the bar
do stray bottles tumble
I feel the misty spray
what a perfect, perfect day for the cabaret
from afar he sees
Venus rise overwhelmingly beautiful
he sighs the look of love was in her eyes
puts his hand upon her leg
looking closer his lust begins to fade
what a drag the queen did say.
could this be a dream I'm in? (Fellini would be proud)
gluttony enfolds the scene
give them one last round,
shining faces dance away
swinging skirts between the panted legs
kaleidescoping
then shassez in a blink the glasses fly
suddenly joy becomes a fight
there they tossed and turned a sight.

Rock,"10,000 Maniacs",Smallest Step,"When the day ends
and church bells are ringing
when the valley is shroudedin snow,
when you're feeling that hope somewhere vanished
and there's no poetry left to console you,
with the smallest step you'll find a way
oh of fate borne and life is a jewel
but stone will tarnish as dust will descend
take a minute and wipe free the lustre,
it'll mirror a day without end
with the smallest step you'll feel
it starts a journey your way.
oh they tried to tell me
but I'll learn for myself
and when they tried to tell me
you know the words disappeared on the wind
I was running away
and when the laughter echoes through you
in a pale beaming ray and you'll know always
and ever within you anyway.

Rock,"10,000 Maniacs",Hidden In My Heart,"I see the leaves of autumn
Changing, falling, turning what was green
I see a door standing open,
Open to curiosity
We could be together
Tear it all apart
Would you ever notice
What was hidden in my heart
Heartstrong
Do we ever listen
Closely as willows start to weep
There as we stood upon the threshold
Who said forever was for keeps?
Would you ever notice what
Was hidden in my heart,
My deep heart is reeling forward
And steady on to keep,
Who made me miss the last ferry?
Who made this river so deep?
