Crouched over
You were not there
Living in fear
But signs were not really that scarce
Obvious tears
But I will not
Hide you through this
I want you to help them, please see
The bleeding heart perched on my shirt
Die, withdraw
Hide in cold sweat
Quivering lips
Ignore remorse
Naming a kid, living wasteland
This time you've tried
All that you can turning you red
Change my attempt good intentions
Should I, could I
Here we are with your obsession
Should I, could I
Crowned hopeless
The article read living wasteland
This time you've tried
All that you can turning you red
but I will not
Hide you through this
I want you to help
Change my attempt good intentions
Should I, could I
Here we are with your obsession
Should I, could I
Heave the silver hollow sliver
Piercing through another victim
Turn and tremble be judgmental
Ignorant to all the symbols
Blind the face with beauty paste
Eventually you'll one day know
Change my attempt good intentions
Limbs tied, skin tight
Self inflicted his perdition
Should I, could I
Change my attempt good intentions
Should I, could I

Feed them, fucken starve them, keep begging a little more
Feed them, fucken starve them, keep begging a little moreFeed them, fucken starve them, keep begging a little more
I'm not gonna be your whore
Load it, cock it, pull it, refuse to be ignored
I'm not gonna fight your warAll the distractions kill the compassion
Suddenly fame has lost its attractionI'm ready to dieWill you kill what's left of me to stop the bleeding?
Shoot it, shoot it out 'cause they want it, want it now, now
Shoot it, shoot it out 'cause they want it, want it now, now
Suffocate integrity till I'm not breathing
Shoot it, shoot it out 'cause they want it, want it now, now

Abused by your prescious presciousHopelessly hopeful; romantically numb
Way to close for closure to comeAround and 'round we go with the rise and fall of your vertigo. Spinning out of control for ever maybe, only made in our dreamsMinimize my movement; amused by your grand illusions

Falling apart

Without a clue of what to do, stumbling on as reckless youth trying to find some truth
Ashes to ashes; dust into dust

Ashes into ashes, dust into dust
Lay your memories out to rust
Bittersweet melodies, amazing grace haunting me
Memories pave the way; ashes to ashesExciting more or less and more between the lines

Why don't you see
That we cannot
Survive in this condition
If you're cut
I'll bleed
So go on
Carve into your own heart
I could use a new scar
Or a brand new start
Slowly severing
The only memories
That bind us as one
I just don't know
How to win
How to win
With you
And I can't let go
Part of me
Part of me
Is you
We have lost
All communication
When words fall
On deaf ears
I'm starting to
Feel a transformation
How did I get here
I don't recognize
My own reflection
It's a ghost of
What once was
Gone from relative to
Stranger separating
Body from mind
I just don't know
How to win
How to win
With you
And I can't let go
Part of me
Part of me
Is you
You stay the same
Allowing me to change
I just don't know

Too fast to focus, nothing is showing
Any sign of slowing down
Dreams fed to me
In the form of a magazine
I can't control it, channels have chosen
What I'm supposed to beIt's hopeless
As far as I can see
There's no rest
'Cause we're stuck on repeatStand here and wait for the world to finally stop
Running in place, chasing after what we
Don't need, keep running
I'll stand here and wait for the world

Bright, flashing lights
The ads just fill my eyes
Colors colliding, voices inviting
Me to buy a better life
She speaks to me
He knows just what I need
I can't control it, I have to own it
Everything's made of greenIt's hopeless

Take it all away, flush it all away

The timid turn to prey

Turning ears deaf to pain

Love in time grows stagnant
The innocence we have lost
New grains of time will not rewindInjuries strain from her perfect art of guile
Swindling her space
In despair
Shed a tear of mock sincerity
Condescending hearts can display
Cracks as your zone if comfort starts to fray
Humbling to sit back and watch through
All of the actions that got you
Clearly no mercyLove in time grows stagnant
The innocence we have lost
New grains of time will not rewind

Through patience I'm viewing from outside
Such a shame your pride
Left you in a state of pure denialLove in time grows stagnant
The innocence we have lost

She drops and kneels and her lips are bare
So please just let me out cuz theres nothing left to say

Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a 12 car garage?
Why you pullin' all these rappers cards?

I turn that fucking soft into some hard
I grew up in the streets without no heart
I'm praying to my Glock and my cardI sit back and read like Cat in the Hat
21 Savage, the cat with the MAC
21 Savage not Boyz N The Hood but I pull up on you, shoot your ass in the back
Stuart Little, heard these niggas some rats
Pockets full of cheese, bitch I got racks
I'm a real street nigga bitch
I am not one of these niggas bangin' on wax
Pussy niggas love sneak dissing 'til I pull up on 'em, slap 'em out with the fire
Wet your mama's house, wet your grandma's house, keep shootin' until somebody die
So many shots the neighbor looked at the calendar, thought it was Fourth of July
You was with your friends playing Nintendo, I was playin' 'round with that fire
Seventh grade I got caught with a pistol, sent me to Pantherville
Eighth grade started playin' football, then I was like fuck the field
Ninth grade I was knocking niggas out, nigga like Holyfield
Fast forward nigga, 2016 and I'm screaming fuck a deal
Bad bitch with me, she so thick, I don't even need a pill
I listen to your raps, thought you was hard
You ain't even street for real
Niggas love sneak dissing on twitter
They don't want beef for real
And all these niggas play like they tough
'till a nigga get killed
'till a nigga get spilled, 'til your blood get spilled
I'ma at your favorite rapper, shoot him like I'm John Dill'
""I been with you since day one, Savage I ain't even hating""
So what's up with all that instagram shit?
""Savage I was just playin'""
Y'all pussy niggas fakin', bitch I hang around them Haitians
Pull up on you, tie your kids up
Pistol whip you while your bitch naked
""Come on man, Savage you know I always play your mixtape""
Yeah nigga fuck all that, ask your bitch how my dick tastes

Stray bullets hitting kids while they playing hop scotch

Niggas actin' like bitches, they got both parts
And I came from the gutter, I don't got no heart
And I'm straight up out the gutter, I don't got no heart
Nigga when they killed my brother, I had to go hard
Put that chopper in his face and then I Bogart
Niggas tryna cross me, I don't understand it
I'm just tryna take care of the family
And I'm sippin' codeine, not brandy (21)
And I'm sippin' codeine, I'm a addict
You go to jail, can't depend on a bad bitch
She fucked and sucked him tryna keep up with the fashion
And I'm really, really rich and I ain't braggin'
Sometimes I really can't believe this shit happened
Who woulda thought I'd make it rappin'?
I almost lost my life when I was trappin'Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money

Got a extendo and a hoodie, he can't wait 'til December
Got a extendo and a hoodie, he gon' shoot you on camera
Lost his faith in Jesus Christ, he prayin' to a bandana
Police gunned his brother down, this shit too hard to handle
Loading up his chopper, he gon' show 'em black lives matterAnother nigga made the news, it ain't nothin' new
He done dropped outta school, it ain't nothin' new
He done got his first tool, it ain't nothin' new
Mama own that dog food, it ain't nothin' new
He smokin' weed and he changin', it ain't nothin' new
All his friends gang bangin', it ain't nothin' new
Got a pocket full of hundreds and they all blue
Another nigga from the hood tryna ball too

Shit gettin' outrageous
Treat us like slaves then they lock us up in cages
Young, black, poor, ain't had a father since a baby
Why you think we skip school and hang out on the pavement?
Why you think we ridin' 'round with choppers off safety?
Streets cutthroat, nigga, so I'm cutthroat
I used to sell dope, nigga, now I can't vote
Poppin' Percocets to kill the pain, I can't cope
Anger in my genes, they used to hang us up with ropes
Civil rights came so they flood the hood with coke
Breakin' down my people, tryna kill our faith and hope
They killed Martin Luther King and all he did was spoke
Welcome to the hood, yeah where niggas dyin' at
Same place where the best chicken gettin' fried at
Same place where the police killin', tellin' lies at
It ain't just the babies, man, I swear the mama's cryin' now

Slide the door back

Put a beam on that

Can't fake love, just want someone who really care
Be loyal to me, want somebody I ain't gotta share

 "
Hip-Hop,21 Savage,Thug Life,"Scrape the corner
Buy a Rover
Crack inside my grandmas sofa
Sunday, family coming over
Move the crack behind the toaster
Carry pistols with no holsters
Trying not to be a poster
You was listening to your coaches
I was listening to the vultures
And I slept with rats and roaches
That's why I don't smoke no roaches
Niggas tryna knock my focus
Wonder why I'm sick of potion
We happy, dog but we ain't jokers
Big bullets, we ain't poking
In that pussy, slow motion
Nigga ain't none of my songs wrote

If he had the password to your phone he wouldn't have cuffed you
Dog ass bitch, I knew I never should've trusted youHoe stab a nigga in the back like the streets do
Can't believe that you betrayed me, I used to sleep with you
Niggas quick to say they loyal to you, they be see-through
Gang, gang, screaming ""Fuck you, they want to eat you""
My son got asthma, grandma having spasms
Fuck the chatter, he gon' tattle, put 'em on the platter
Snakes plotting on my downfall like I'm hearing rattle
(That fuck nigga gone flop man
21 ain't even no real nigga, fuck that nigga)
We sticking to the G code, nigga we ain't beefin' over freak ho's
I hit her on the D low, yeah she like my steelo
That nigga think that he a bullet, don't like credit, Deebow
30-round hangin' out the big Glock
Nigga, no six shots, shootin' 'til the clip stops
You a lil' cat, I'm a big dog
Nigga, when we pullin' up the stick's out
Too much money got 'em pissed off

Your baby brother used to be my crash dummy
Don't call my phone if it ain't 'bout cash money
I don't wanna talk if it ain't 'bout cash money
I got a lot of shooters 'round me and they hungry
He sold a zip and now he acting like he Tony
I be chasing after money like I'm homeless
I had to leave that bitch alone cause she was bogus
Put a 100 on your head
Now a nigga dead
You niggas know that Young Savage will paint the city red
I don't want to do no song with these niggas cause they scared
Draco on the seat I keep that Draco on the seat
Molly, percs and weed you know these bitches like to eat
Slaughter gang, we slaughter hoes cause half these bitches freaks
All the shit I've been through man it change a young G
That's why I keep that hundred round drum around me
That's why I keep a lot of fucking guns around me
If you ain't with the gang you better not come around me
All that mother fucking leashing ain't no bum around me
You like that pillow talk but niggas shoot for fun around me

Tryna make the work double up, I beat the bowl up
Tryna make the work double up to meet my quota
.40 on my hip, you know that chopper on my shoulder
I remember hard times when it was no love
I remember fast money and them slow bucks
I got all this gold on me like the gold rush
VVS's drippin' on me it's a hotel
I remember shoot outs niggas, broad day
Remember when I hit that nigga with the K
Niggas ain't loyal, nigga they'll betray you
Shoot 'em in the temple, give that nigga a fade
My dog got life and shit ain't been the same
All I got is money bags on my brain
Go hard in the booth and buy another chain
I do it for the money nigga, not the fame

Got me thinkin' to myself
Ain't no real niggas left
Cuz all the real niggas left
They either dead or down the road
Niggas goin' out bad
They'll kill you bout a ho
Man these streets so cold, so cold
I swear these streets so cold, so cold
I pray to god that he watch my soul
And let me know whose a friend or a foe

Shootouts in apartments made my mama cry
Seen my niggas in a hearse, I Stevie Wonder-ed why
Retaliation, let 'em [?] like it's the Fourth JulyNow I'm on Ocean Drive sipping codeine with the top down
20 grand on me, lot of jewelry and a Glock nine
Got my own money, pussy nigga I did not sign
Say Young Savage name in a song, it's some shots fired
I'm on Ocean Drive sipping codeine with the top down
20 grand on me, lot of jewelry and a Glock nine
Lot of jewelry and a Glock nine
Lot of jewelry and a Glock nine
I'm on Ocean Drive sipping codeine with the top down

A funky child with some words on my tongue
Be like intake of breath and my mouth gets loose
So while I scatter my spit, I dream of juice
Have you ever made out in dark hallways
Displayed a kiss that made your day or say
Played a track from your record collection
It's your mix, congratulationsWe've changed a lot and then some, some
You know that we have always been down, down
If I ever didn't thank you, you
Then just let me do it nowI bet you light up when we start the show
Follow me now very closely 'cuz I told you so
You know, we glow because we throw sun rays
Yeah we be freaky and we wanna stay

So many variables came up as unknown
So I stayed up all night long writing out the code
But by morning light I lost all my concentration, yeahHey yo, hey yo, is our mind even open at all?
Hey yo, hey yo, communication is broken, hit a wall
By the time we get out of line it's all over for composure
Hey yo, hey yo, do you hear what I'm saying?
Is our mind even open at all?Has the world ever granted you anything that you wish for?
Has your soul felt uncertain on a future outside your door?
Let the moments come, let go and let go and let go until it's all gone
Has the world ever granted you anything that you wish for?

Not goin' for self, that shit is on the shelf
It's '95, we go for the hiveListen up to this, you're gonna bump to this
And if I'm feelin' mean I'm gonna clutch my fist
Now when I say mean, I mean I'm gonna rock it
You're gonna find out, kid, I'm 'bout to shock it
When I'm on I'm gone, I hear the beat that spawns
The way we freak it, and we kick up a storm
The day we turn to pop the show will stop, so
Feel the beat and get lost, now
Back to part two, the hard way we play
Sublime on time, to all the fans I'm SA
And if you don't know I say check the show
Do what you got to on the dance flo'
Some say the style is wack but I say fuck that
Get the hell back and watch us rock the set
We cast the mold, bust it cold explode
Mega-trendsetters known around the globe
Friends takin' you where you never been
We done what we wanted craftin' poems
You can rock, there is a glow around you
Lose control, holmes, just like we do
Hard to obtain, brotha, what's my name?
Mad to find unlike ya' mama and your masquerade
I drive a Mach-1, no dashboard Jesus

Je vais a la plage parce que le guignol est chouette!

Another tale of ordinary madness
The girl who gave you her sex I heard was homeless say
All I really wanna is to feel nirvana
Won't you take me tonight and we just might find
A bottle of wine and feel our nasty nature
Your toung lickin' up my tounge
Your radio pickin' up a smokey jazz love song
Madness becomes you even though your
Livin' life it's hard to exist when you're tempted
By flesh you wanna bust through
Beautiful legs in the bar there is poetry
She bends and suspends and her ass
Is a marvelous thing
A dance dancin' at a club the Hereafter
Who can't really dance but that doesn't really matter
And she won't hear applause
Cus your drunk and lost
All light is gone
Your arms spread like a cross
And you're dreaming that the world
Will soon fall apart
Topless firl in your gaze
Which is hazy
Takes your dollar
In the gutter without cigarettes
Or wine your hungover
I was warned of your normal
Behaviour and felt
My life was too short to
Consider your wack self
It's like this when you dip down
And you are boxin'
Reeling against the ropes and you
Face some young Mexican
Your scrappin' your kneck gets
Snapped back your eyes have bled
Your thinking' about a comeback
But your takin' it to the head
You little bastard
Better watch you back
Cuz we're after
Your punk ass by God we're gonna jack it
You're played out and small time
And your show is over
You're 'bout as lucky as a three leaf clover
And your older ho bag sceezer
In her droopy saggy skin
Who thoughtshe was a model
But in truth a never-has-been
You both are fools
You and your cheap rooms too
The cigar biting your lips the way love use to

So I'd thought I'd come out with a shot
Stupid dumb lyrics make you think I'm a clown
I don't give a fuck it's time to throw downFuck the bullshit it's time to throw down
Fuck the bullshit it's time to throw down
Fuck the bullshit it's time to throw down
Fuck the bullshit it's time to throw down




 "
Rock,311,Offbeat Bare-ass,"Any different people can apply to drop the funk
It's not a country club review board steady talkin junk
Many people would have it others go put and grab it
Some trip over toots and say fuck it I'm sunk
I put it in a limerick and kick the slick nick verbs
I am the one who scores the herb
When we're on the road P-Nut rolls it up
Throw me a joint on stage what's up
I will tell a cop that I know my fucking rights
And we can match wits all night for real
He said if I had nothing to hide
Then of course I wouldn't mind if he looked through our ride
Uh, no I'd really rather you didn't
And no we don't have guns hidden
We stood there for a while continue to decline
Firmly, I didn't lose my mind
I didn't let him break me he's just another human
Not a bit of shame in what we were doin' that day
He couldn't make us stay
We had our shit together
It don't matter whether
We sport the dread locks or a shaved head
Or if we have a sticker from the dead
I said a better verse rehearsed about the roughneck curse
Last week I keep an even keel and bow in place
And face the music every minute

Never could see my homey comin' till he passed
Funky gas by my way all the day I couldn't laugh
Oh by now I'm chill with it
Bare ass in my face I'm ok but Chad's like ""Uh-uh no he isn't""
So I proceed to hear him get loose with the
Fartin' all over my face sometimes my tummy
He fucked with my flow although I thought it funny
I probably wouldn't care if I smoked more kind bud
But that wouldn't do me shit cuz then he'd fuck me more up
Crazy ill and chillin' rude but I'ze a real cool dude
He didn't believe the day would come when he would get his top
But then one day right in front of his face I got him
He looked over said ""God damn get me some water""
The one time I hadn't wasted till I got mine
Smeared his nose with my armpit funk slime
So you get it the picture just how sick we were then
But before I jet ""Hey yo Chad sniff my finger man""

I can see a lot of people who feel like I do
I can see a lot of people who feel like I don't
I go on step lightly even when I'm heavy
High jump the slump open up fot eh Revy Horton Heat
Sweet what am I displayin' forgot what I was saying
I know I must be laying a pipe you got a gripe
With the way I get high
Graffix bong sing along with a cry of a
Mandatory sentence for a crime with no victim
When everyone knows jail terms should be picked in
Order of the pain that they cause
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law
Until you violate the rights of another
Respect the space of your sister and your brother
The war on drugs may be well intentioned
But it falls fucking flat when you stop and mention
The overcrowded prisons where a rapists gets paroled
To make room for a dude who has sold
A pound of weed to me that's a crime
Here's to good people doin time y'allBare Ass Yeah x4

Circumvent the limits come through disarray
Greater ascension cause I was born to elevate
Never have been one to be cast away
We're going stronger, take it in along the way
I got this super OG and it goes crazy
It's an extension, this reach is so far away
Now we just break it on down, heyStand up and create could be on anything that we set our mind
United by fire to be undefined
Working all the time and gonna be hard because we came to play
That's because you wouldn't have it any other way
The reaches all the reaches of the intake of mind
I find a place where I can go where no one ever will find
I make a perfect exchange, I make it kind acting strange
Sometimes the places that I go make people think I'm deranged
If there's a reason that you're holding up the wall let it fall
I think it's treason when I'm sick of people throwing it all
I let them all just fly by with a quick wink to the eye
I think you all better quick just listen in your ride

Stand undefeated in anything that we set
Our mind united by fire to be undefined
It's an extension, this reach is so far away
Now we just give you something sweetBecause the people lay heavy when they are so far away
Something about that decade they can't give a day
What do you play?
Thinking about the people we're jumping the two or three
We're keeping it dry till we goodbye the limits of the weight, heyIf there is a spirit and it's making our way
Seeing all the people traffic to it and they come around, they come around and
You look and bear it cause there's no other way
And so they step into the ground, they've all been getting down

I think you know what I mean
a reality break to a place unseen
things come alive stupefied mind quarantined
from sleeping then awaken to somewhere in between
ay, I'm on a cloud parfait
I jump into the valley of the far from mundane
my knees buckle a chuckle chuckle
mutha fucka I get back up
like there never was a scuffleStrange like a tale from Brothers Grimm
they're watching you we can't look at them
living life out here like on a limb
one or the other sink or swim
maximum velocity
yet speeding up so rapidly
there's no where else I'd rather be, for me

They keep you high, won't let you come down
distract the facts ma'am, that's the plan now
where you work, where you lurk, what you search
climb too much get off of that perch
virtual reality your nightmare
on the grid, kid, getting nowhere
get ahead, leave behind
lose your mind find in time
a nowhere rhymeChemicals up in the atmosphere
another meteor is falling near
buried in the headlines disappear
I'm not the type to live in fear
you dream but I know you're awake
explaining a nightmare you couldn't shake
maybe the kool-aid that you drank today

We're breaking away from the past
reaching a new plane at last
regardless of what cards get played
no one can keep you afraidUnless you wanna be
you make that choice indubitably
they wanna play my emotions
but I'm like the ocean
too calm to get upset by somebody's notionFuture makers
organ takers
a non-human intelligence is guiding
worlds colliding
far away star system
I string DNA where I need 'emWhat we gonna get with a zero field
gotta have the one to make it real
I tell ya that more will be revealed
the mystery don't bother me
everyday masquerade
there's always too many plans we laid
keep going faster down the grade we madeWe're breaking away from the past
reaching a new plane at last
regardless of what cards get played
no one can keep you afraidWe're always beginning
as sure as we're spinning
for it's never ending from here
after all this time
I am sorry I'm not sorry
hate me later
something greater
than the petty here and nowVenture on
the sketch is not completely drawn
travel wide
it's not hiding inside
venture on
the sketch is not completely drawn
travel wide
its out beyond the great divide

Rock,311,Wildfire,"Start the game, I'm breaking all that came
You know that you have lost at the second you delay
Play the gate, it lies in your biology
Rising up the temperature, useless technology
Park the car and walk under the stars
So goddamn afraid to let down your gua-a-ard
You can see I'm talking bu-bu-but me
That's just what it is like in the wildfireIt's me me me
I am more than what you see
Pouring out my cranium on the m-i-c
I'm gonna come in harder
To the thirsty bringing water
Thought you wanted it to get higher
But you're in the wildfire now

People told us it would never transpire
You could be defeated in advance
Just let them all burn in the wildfireLet me tell you what you might not know
When the chips are down I mean lower than low
You might think this dude won't show
Cause I done robbed Knox and took all the gold
We'll overcome with our squad and we'll get in the mix
And you can pray to your god but your god can't fix
How I look at this world and if I am crying
It's cause I'm at the bigger life and I'm a die laughing

Just let them all burn in the wildfireLife goes on and on
The decisions so many times they make themselves
And in the aftermath
You cannot take it back
Your point of view is everything
That you're making
Rude awakening
Hate to be the one to tell you so
I thought that you should know
Cause that's what I'm here for
Told you I'd never goAnd when the morning comes
You know I'll still be here
One thing you should not fear
Whatever things that come
Through the rain
And the sunshine and the pain
We'll look back and smile
When all is said and been done
When the song is sung

You should just give me a callI think about you much more than I should
Now there's a structure nothing had once stood
No more bluffing it's cards on the table time
What it must be we will take it as a signSo just give me a call

In darkness will it lead me

no flowers I forgot them

What it must be we will take it as a signSo just give me a call
So just give me a callI call you up but you won't talk to me
No space for words there's just no room
I drift away but you pull me in
I'm the ocean youre the moonOoh how do I know if it's just me
Sometimes I think that it must be
You gotta know you can trust meI think about you much more than I should
Now there's a structure nothing had once stood

Once I met a man who made nearly no mistakes
He would never bet on a longshot and he'd never bet on a break and
He's condescending and talks gossip galore
But the dude was definitely such a boreHear me now I messed up but I got back trying
Don't bother lying 'bout constant disappointment
But the fun is in the hunt so quit actin' on a frontYeah, unmotivated you're sort faded
But the real man is not the one hiding behind the gunshot, boom!Time travelin' through my memory
There's a younger Doug gazin' at the galaxy
Space trippin' vato of the stars
Searchin' for UFO's from Neptune and MarsOde to an alien I know you're out there
Cosmic lonely heart tell me if you care
I'm listening for your sound, here on the ground
I'm listening for your sound, here on the groundWhen I'm on the microphone

Boy actin' coy you got nuts like Almond Joy

Where there's fight there's struggling
I can't walk through the world
Without offering questions
What's my direction
Breakin' the grip of depression
There comes a day when you let THINGS go
There comes a time to a rock showYou know the time that you feel
THAT nothing else really matters
You're on the spot in the world
AND you belong
That's where I am when the lights going down
I'll find a way to make some fun
I know that there is a link of energy

Where the shore meets the sea
Man I'm hummin' I'm humminI'm free as I stare at the sea.
And I'm not comin' down.
The world is yours once you have found.
The good is to share.
Which is elsewhere.The beauty
of green is where light is now broken
by what it touches.
Remembering
what you once had told me hit home.
And hasn't it always been so.

Rock,311,Flowing,"Along the way to close my eyes
I lost where I was going
the more it will spin
the more that I try
to stop my mind flowing away, away
to all that I despise
along the way to close my eyesYou can't be let down if you don't expect the world
expect to lay awake and by your sleeping girl
if somebody cares then there is no way you can tell
cursed consciousness is your private hell

Haven't heard yet but you can bet I'm not with that
With that talk with the digi walk
I stalk a bird you heard absurd word to the Fact
I'm a cat nippin sippin on the flask
Passin it talking shit but only if your ass
In front of me cause you could run from me but
In the end revenge send ends to the defendant
I can't get get caught in the spiral cause every bit of energy
It goes to my survival out my way
I'm a flicka flacka blotter ya try to find a weakness
But the shit keeps gettin harderFourth of July with Lucy in Sky
I remember pine trees and the coat of many colors
I was nineteen
I'd do anything
Shit like that now scares me but I'd like to do it again
It was Independence day
I've seen the other side and I say
I've been insane
And I won't ever be the same

First to flow Nickel my brother, so wise
And then I rise
Here's an ill kid pimpin' cuz he is so slick
Step's from darkness his body electric
A drone buzzes the air a cracklin' tone
Then boomin' like thunder in a cosmic jungle
Deathe defyin; like Knievel he weeble
Words that will wobble awkward and evil
Cuz he flow and rock the hardest of the crowds
A marvel pow how you like me now
I've returned the kiss of death the last Damien
From the abyss fresh eternal alien
Now famished from pathless way I ma, do damage

Blending all the flavors only mixing in the perfect ones

Tell me what you say
You see it all so clearly
There's nowhere on Earth to be
On the open sea

Oh bake it like a snowflake, drink the water it becomes
As it melts awayOut of bounds
Seemingly lost and found
Come around
As we sail awayYou gotta come along with me as we float across the sea
Mixing all the elements with alien technology
A secret message hidden in this tune
Now let me hear it from you

Wake up every morning and the feeling is nice
We're not living the dream, we're living the life

And it will go out that is no doubt
The circle of everything is what it's about

One and the same means the Yin and Yang comprising everything
Greater than the sum of the parts that's why we got this far
Vital to the survival of the human race
That's why we're letting them know scream in your fucking faceOne and the same
With a bang
Do or die with your mains
Ain't nothing changed
Or so strange
With burning sage in the caves
Can never gauge renegades
Whipping up your parade
No matter age or the decade
We're not lost in a purple hazeCome to find out we're highly indivisible
Gonna find out we're something like invincible

But the leak's still spilling
They don't know what to do
The flow won't stop
Pressure still won't drop
Tanks are overfilling

Wading through the stream

All stressed out working til your eyes bleed

Is you go loco loco
And too much of this way
And you'll go postal postal
Happens all the time get in line
And go comatoseThe moms and pops
Have all closed up shop
And who can blame them
I don't know anyone
The kids just hide
Scared to go outside
And just who can blame themAt times it seems unreal
We can see but we can't feel
And no one's at the wheel
Born here all alone
Growing old with hearts of stone
The lights are on
But no one's homeForward we crawl
Backwards we fall
Through the Ebb and the Flow
Living within a dream
Wading through the stream
Beyond the Ebb and FlowImages we have made
Cross and fade

I'm not from Philly but some say I'm blunt
That's just the way I am, and no I'm not going to front
And yes I took a trip to find about the ways of big city
Seedy bars and drugs that make you feel shitty
Pretty older women in skirts, conversation frisky
Stinking cigarettes and plenty of bourbon whiskey
Sad classic music on the jukebox of doom
Hollywood Boulevard, barfly frolic room
Tomb of lost souls, some beyond salvage
Some just having fun opening steam valvage
I was one becoming the other, hellbent to discover
Had to pull up the reigns or else smother, take it brother
All the way and then you're scared
Don't want to be unprepared
You're getting paranoid and then guns are shared
You guys think that you're hard
But you're in fear of being harmed

 "
Rock,311,Hostile Apostle,"I can't free myself of the suspicion
For your motives on your mission
Some people live for the rules, I live for exceptions
Can't take part in the deception
But I know just how it feels, to wanna blow the world away
Just to get to what is real, it won't work cuz
Everybody grinds to a halt now and then
Everybody's game gets salt then again
No matter what the papers say they're normal as they come
Bodyguards, ball of wax, they hide behind the gun
They get a panic pulse when they are so far from home
To me that is the reason to continue to roam
Exhilaration mix with the people skunk blazing
Checking out the shows that are sadly unamazing

Chorus:
Hostile Apostle who you following
Negative energy that you're swallowing
Some coked out mal-content, who's soul is up for rent
Victim of lost soul Hostile ApostleUnlimited in time and space and nearest universal
Light is what we're reachin for it's not rehearsal
Follow this around follow this hustle
Makin use of everything movin all your muscle
Angry human leads impressionable boy
To skulls and piercings and will to destroy
All of your heroes speak nothing to me
One emotion one tempo and no real feeling
In this field we are the presence of the thoughts you're missin
Keepin positive's intact from all the people dissin
Open your eyes look at who you're kissin
If you can't hear it, people just listen

(Chorus)Angry human leads impressionable boy
To skulls and piercings will to destroy
All of your heroes speak nothing to me
You don't have to be a prick just to be heavy
Changin all the time we changin all the same
Change in this life and this eternal frame
Warm in the sun refresh in the breeze
Glow in the stars blossom in the trees
Livin through life in infinite extent
Spread undivided operate unspent
No high, no low no great and no small
Build and bound connect and equal all




 "
Rock,311,Wake Your Mind Up,"Chorus:
Wake your mind up clear your eyes up
Move and rise up before your times up
Clock is ticking, you're caught slippin
Stop to realize look and listenWell I guess that's life when you see a dark road up the way
And I guess that's life when you gotta roll through anyway
Now don't scream, don't fight fear, never ever made it go away
Some ghost town as yesterday
Made you feel like love was miles away

(Chorus)Now those sleepless nights thoughts just cloud up my brain
Feeling helpless repeating the same old memories of pain and I wish it would rain, yo
Gimme starlit skies fro dreamland
I know it's really smaller than it seems
But when the pressure gets under my skin
I just wanna get out and scream in the wind, yo
The world we're livin in is complicated
The streets that we walk on are dark and jaded
A wandering soul that's filled with hatred
In it is poison the youth is tainted
Social engineering keeps us seperated
Media control is highly overrated
Ignorance is bliss to those uneducated
Listen to the message cuz it's time we faced it(Chorus)

I'm controller of my destination
Gotta change my mind to help me break away
The sun creeps over the hillside to shed this light
No man could ever take away
I guess that's life you see a new side from the norm
A new direction and meaning to the form
And the calm in the eye of the storm, yo
Show me a desert that can never be drenched
I'll show you a thirst that can never be quenched
Temptation chronicles, the story of my life
Been spent on a dose of balancing strife
Inspiration it comes and goes
You can bet when it hits I'm on the phone
Singing to my voicemail trying to get it down
In a sensation of shape shifting sound
You're telling fables to cover up your foibles
From overindulgence on things you find enjoyable
Designed to take my mind away from truth
Try to make me play the sleuth
They want you to think someone's watching you
So they can make up a set of rules for you
I'm just trying to find a path that I can stomach
Just trying to make some sense out from it
Don't stop what you got
Don't stop til you find the sweet spot(Chorus)




 "
Rock,311,Beyond The Gray Sky,"it is a gift i know
a moment of bliss that we hold
a firecracker flash of light then on
to the next plan soul remain
come along if you dare
it's gonna be that you're scared
lovely life i thank you
for the reason to see the pain throughlight a candle for the dead
the wick is burning returning what we have

Because cutting through the crap is my specialty
Like a bomb I'm dropping yes a ton of lead
You're trying to figure out the last thing I saidI'm a redwood I love to be a tree yes I'm a druid
My words are flowing out like a fluid
Never give in never conform
I'll be bustin' out rhymes in a triplet formDead leaves on the trees in spring can't hear the birds sing
A light powdered snow on the ground is glistening
Vipers slither atop a colder ground they quiver
A crack in the sky snow is falling and inside we shiverWhile I doze I suppose I could get lost
With a brown skin friend claiming kin to crazy horse
I stink of vino my greasy clothes are rancid but
I tip the bottle back the spirits are in me kid

Firewater the world's a mixture
Of broken liquored people get the pictureYou're hangin' around the house with all your friends
Steady drinking smoking the green weed
And head is sort of blinking you're going with the flow
And everybody is getting plowedThe voices and the music and the noise is getting loud
You got a heavy buzz on when seven o'clock rolls around
So you piule inside the clunker start heading downtown
Only nineteen but you know where you can get itSo you slide inside the bar and everything is hitting
By about eleven o'clock your brain is near dead
You really can't remember who was the one that said
Let's go into the bathroom and meet this guy Chuck
He's got a thirty dollar white powder pick me upTen minutes later the whole vibe had changed
You try for conversation but you know you're acting strange
Your eyes are wide open but your smile is gone
You just keep fiending 'til the fucking break of dawnVipers slither atop a colder ground they quiver
A crack in the sky snow is falling and inside we shiver

Into whose womb were you woven what kin of your skin dropped you then
Bodies cloven
Light of daybreak blinded next exit
The wild darkness forming inside it
My day wasn't promised me each death it brings reminding me we
Are rumbling through this cursed universe where death is birth
Think not but what your manifest is worth
Giving up a verse the curse occurs a thirst
To burst first breaking through the center of the universe
Slamming down on the lingo flow so jam to the bumrush single
Long ago has been become now when you find out there's no break
In the rhythm. Black anima makes my stamina stand alone disown the cinema farewell to posing decades dozing comin up the steps of the new
Screen rising scenes from the lost world shapes hard to tell. Which is which as if drawn by a child holmesChorus
This is the heat to flush your face

Rock,311,Existential Hero,"Whole world! From the high country to the bottom of the sea
I caught a place that I needed to be
it comes and it goes, the momentary glory
then, quick as they came they're down the drain
another one coming from a shallow place will not remain
remember when what was possible would never end
now we abide by limits I cannot defend
it fits good and yet the best we reject
you get what you get I guess don't get upset

under stars and the trees and

planets follow patterns, we fall into seasons

Prepare to bare all
I paint the cave walls
I am the hobbit
with the ring in the forrest
I am the richest I am the poorest
a particle I vibe I just keep dancin'
I move from this world into a mansion
of light and love as below and above
I chart the planets and the whales migration
I'm home everywhere I run the station
the last light of a dying star
in every game I am that wild card
I participate I'm paleolithic
and geology and astrophysics
a true cowboy existential hero
I compiled that deck and named it tarot
I'm in play I want the ball
I'm buddha with amnesia then sudden recallSomehow I fell into it all again, it all again
somehow I fell into it all again, it all makes sense

Take it to 'em bro, throw down, now say
Settin' forth a course I'm really wiggin' out
In my dome I roam, no time to doubt
Fucked up you right there while I was rhymin'
Now you're sulking in the corner, a baby crying
Hittin' up now we feelin' to rock Mars
Fuckin' up the shit, now their heads bob
We ain't new to jack swing, the groove and that
We got crazy factiffs and we all that
I don't often rock and I'm a laureate
I don't pull the punch you know I'm throwin' it
Freestyles my style on the mic and flex
You're stalkin' the mind of a punk that's nextI get retarted now that I started you know
A condition which I keep close together
Like the kind buds you know my scene
My team thinks I sing supreme, but you, the weasel,
Try to bring us down but in reality it make you look like a clown
Too bad cause we'll be sittin' in the sun and choose a rocky ass fast ballIn your face
That's right
And it feels so good
Choose a lock y'all
In your face
Yeah
It feels so goodYo P-Nut, beat that thingWon't you warm the mic Nicholas
Can't get with this my stream of conscieceness is a sea
Much like Bukowski with a rage
Speakin' to page
Beasts in the cage
Jumpin' off the stage

Thrivin'
Strivin' for a better day or say
(Strive for a better day SA?)
Beat back by flesh
Shatterd doors braggin' fists to the sky we're feelin' high
Has to live and dieJust take a moment to have a fit once in a while
You know, you know
I do it daily and like it but that's my style, yeah, here I goIn your face

Rock,311,Speak Easy,"If there's a scream inside of you
Just let it go
You're beating yourself up baby
Don't you know
You've got to get through
And lift the roof off your soulIt's like the pain locked
In the part of your heart
It's never gonna leave it
Unless you start
To warm it up
Be wise and be smartOut on the ocean
There's no one around
No one to hear a sound
It's just us out here
Out on the ocean
Speaking free

Away from the city
Away from the ears that
Bug us and judge us
It's so liberating
To be free
And my heart slows downNice and easy
And your breathing will be pleasing
Just speak easy
And say what's on your mind
I search for something
To compare you to
Thought long and hard
For a simile true
Now I'm suddenly aware
End the quest you're beyond compare
So speak easy

Full moon that's glowing
On the seaNice and easy

Stand up, musical revolution
Follow me because we can never stop

In the spiral threatening my survival
It's come, time to get downIt's time to get down
Boots to the ground
Know we don't stop 'til they hear the bell sound
Keep your head up
Cause the truth just cut
No quick fix when I'm caught in a rut
What I got to do to get right size
Think I'm despised when I look through the eyes
Of another
Not mine to discover
What the next man think is none of my fucking business

Not hitching around your spur
Over the river and trough the woods
I've come this far to bring in the goods
I get high, even when I don't try
Let 'em pass by with a wink to the eye
I reserve the right to be stoned
I reserve the right to take it to collect them sums I have the right
Don't try to be, there's really no point in you biting me
I'm glad to see that it's easy for me to be an MC
Let me tell you a little story
Like my dog Bobby, he hated the pool man
So I tried to play Kotter and make things cool
And I said just let him smell you, hold out your hand
He reached it on out, and then bam
He bit him, he bit him so fuckin' hard
Blood was steady gushin' all over my back yard
I kept apologizing, I felt so fuckin' bad
The dude was so cool, he didn't even get mad
He said man don't sweat it, that's the dog's meaning
Took some Neosporin and went back to his cleaning

Your mind can have a joint easy like jungle boogie

Would you mind come but I gots my dog
Come you can foam the water with the bone

A cracker on a truck goin' breaker breaker

The truth is what you shoot for not one
Nothing brings it all together the journeys never done
I'd sing you Stormy Weather but it's been sung so

Knowing no perdition that's my game for instance
Three Eleven true to no tradition
And the Three Eleven crew not dow with convention
But a hundred different people already told what we about
So I make not attempt to try and suss the stupid out
I'd turned into a roughneck that was not my intention
It doesn't even really matter unless I fail to mention that
Peace to all crews that want some peace
First the Mid then the West then we slide through the East
A piece to any crew that want a peice
But peace to all crews that want peace
Check it outI look to absolutes and there absolutely none
The truth is what you shoot for not one

the words just poured out of you like a melody
I just could not believe the things you're telling meCome closer, come closerNothing could be half so compelling
as you and me, our senses telling us where to go
you give me quite a show

Rock,311,Made in the Shade,"Sitting by the bedroom window, looking at a slideshow on a Sunday But it's Monday, well how would I know.
I've been looking at the same old window, Years later on a Monday.
Thinking something would come from doing the same thing.
About time to give up on the same old stuff I'm stuck on.
And just say that it went wrong and move along.
Sayonara, till tomorrow, it's just how it goes sometimes.
You gotta keep on climbing the hill.
Cause if you think you'll make it you will.
Go swimming quick like a fish and every wish will be fulfilled.
Strike up and start the parade.
Cutting down the weeds keep swinging the blade.
And when you fire that warning shot you'll have a spot made in the shade.
Standing at a side street station, Feeling like one way on the down low.
Flying solo till further delay.
Easy blame it on procrastination, Always hoping somehow that the nonsense.
This time will make sense, stuck in circles.
Faces in the sunshine, they never look at mine.
People just walk by, and keep their eyes low.
Sayonara, till tomorrow its just how it goes.
You gotta keep on climbing the hill Cause if you think you'll make it you will Go swimming quick like a fish and every wish will be fulfilled Strike up and start the parade cutting down the weeds keep swinging the blade and when you fire that warning shot you'll have a spot made in the shade

Baby don't cry, I can see we've lost the feeling
Won't you open your eyes, and try to find your smile
We've known each other too long, to let it all slip away
When all's said and done, we've said our last goodbye
Baby don't cryBaby, we've been living a lie
And even though it hurts deep inside
I know there can be no, no, no compromise
'Cause too many chances have passed
And if you want a love that can last
Never try to push things too fast
And though I've no regrets
I still recall the night we met
We said that we'd never end, so baby lisenBaby don't cry, I can see we've lost the feeling
Won't you open your eyes, and try to find your smile
We've known each other too long, to let it all slip away

All the memories we had, I wouldn't change a thing
And with the lights down low, I'm dreaming of what could have been
Even though we've tried so many times before
I'll take one look around, before I close the door
With this one last kiss I know deep down inside
The beginning of the end, the ending of our time
Maybe we could try, but no, it's just too late
Just another cruel twist of fateLooking back through the years
Time has dried all our tears
But all good things must end, oh just listenBaby don't cry, I can see we've lost the feeling
Won't you open your eyes, and try to find your smile
We've known each other too long, to let it all slip away

Won't you open your eyes, baby don't cry

Won't be the last time.
No no no
Don't you worry I don't mean to make you sad
My tears will soon be over
With your conscience clear
For a new life ahead
Don't be sorry
I really need to hear the truth
The only thing I'm asking
Cause I need you to
Remember me,
As the only one who set you free
Maybe time alone will make you see
How deep our love could be
You know it's never too late
Cause I know
This isn't the first time
Won't be the last time
I surrender my soul
Cause your always
Keeping me waiting
Anticipating
The day we find love once again
Oh no
I won't give up while
There's a glimmer of a chance
A dream is never ending
Inviting love and perfect romance
A burning passion
Oh baby your my destiny
But the message I'm receiving
Is your through with me
But I'll be there
Even though you tell me you don't care, no
How could you forget the times we've shared
Don't throw our love away
You know it's never too late
Cause I know
This isn't the first time
Won't be the last time
I surrender my soul
Cause your always
Keeping me waiting
Anticipating
The day we find love once again
Ooh remember me
As the only one who set you free
Maybe time alone will make you see
How deep our love could be
No it's never too late
No no
No no
Isn't the first time
Won't be the last time
I surrender my soul
Cause your always
Keeping me waiting
Anticipating
The day we find love once again.

Pop,911,Vision In My Mind,"I lie awake in the heart of the night,
I just can't rest 'til you're by my side
Staring at the ceiling, scared to close my eyes
I gotta let you know you're the vision in my mind
So many lonely nights still as the pale moon light
Drift in a river of dreams, together, you and I
Flow forever, any tide of the motion
I will promise complete devotion
And love will never compromise
Something so sacred can't be denied
Chorus:
Gotta let you know you're the vision in my mind, girl
With heart and soul, every second of my time's for you
Been hurt before, I know you're holding back your feelings, girl
Please realize I'd be the one to change your world
I see that look in your eyes, been hurt just too many times
And like the healing hand of time
I'm gonna dry every tear you cry
I'd tear down the walls of isolation, oh, baby, believe I belong
The love is pure, the love is so strong
Give me the chance to prove I am wrong
Repeat Chorus twice
I lie awake in the heart of the night
Just can't rest 'til you're by my side
Staring at the ceiling, scared to close my eyes
I gotta let you know you're the vision in my mind

No holding back the tears we've cried

To bring you back to me again
Oh say that we can heal this pain
Turn the spark into a flame
I know that we can bring it back again
So baby please can't you see I'm down on my kneesBaby come back to me

Pop,911,Don't Walk Away,"Writers: McLaughlin/James
Can't believe we're standing here
Saying that we're leaving
While holding back the tears
I remember everything we've shared
Through all the years
Why does it have to end this way
Is this the bitter pill
That we have to take
And now we've come this far
Is this the price we pay
Can we win it back again
Chorus:
So don't walk away
We can save our love
If we just keep the faith
Let's turn the tide, before it's too late
Don't let it go, don't walk away
Sometimes we don't see eye to eye
And in the past, we may have danced a little out of time
And after all the different roads we've walked together
Let's make it right
Let's start tonight
Chorus
All it takes is understanding
The answer's right there in our hearts
We can reach a new horizon
If we keep the hope alive
And all the things will turn out right

Pop,911,Moving on,"Moving on our way
Moving on our wayI will always remember
Our first days together
It felt like we had known each other forever
We were dreamers
And we were believers
To give up everything
To follow this dream
But one thing that we have learnt
Is to stand, together as one
And nothing will overcome
And nothing's gonna stop us now
Moving on our way

Pop,911,Take Good Care,"I've been broken-hearted
It felt like my world was caving in, leaving me lonely
It felt like my head was in a spin
I'd too and I'd turn all night, wondering how it came to be
I've been there, and I never will return
If you're honest, girl (honest, girl)
You will be my world (be my world)
And I'll be there if you take good care forever
Take good care of my heart, and I won't let you down, girl
Take good care of my heart, I'll always be around, girl
Take good care of my heart, and I will leave you never
If you take good care forever
I'd do about anything
To show you that my love is strong enough
Whether it's rain or shine
Even when the going gets too tough
I'll be there, on this, you can rely
If you'll be my girl (be my girl)
I'll promise the world (promise the world)
And my love, I'll share if you take good care forever
Repeat 
I used to make believe
There was a girl of my dreams (girl of my dreams)
When I opened up my eyes
I saw my dreams have come to life

Pop,911,Should've Been The One,"Writers: McLaughlin/James
My baby, should've been the one
Last night I was so scared I couldn't close my eyes
You still live in me
Some how I made it through the night
Rescued by the break of day, once again
I know someone's in your heart, it's pulling me apart
But I guess I'm the one to blame (it's so hard)
And it's so hard (so hard) holding back the tears now you've dissapeared
How I long to hold you near
Chorus:
Oh I should've been the one who's with you now
Should've been the one that's feeling proud
I failed you now
Oh I should've read the signs in your eyes
Should've had the sense to realise
I've lost you now
I see you, laughing out loud standing in the crowd
The same crowd I used to know
But it's too late now to change anything
I've lost everything
Gotta learn to let you go
Chorus
I should've been the light in your eyes (should've been the light)
Should've been the fire in your smile (should've been the fire)
I should've been your spirit and your guide
I wonder do you think of me? (do you think of me?)
Maybe you shed a tear for me (shed a tear for me)
I realise I paid the price but nothing's gonna change the way I fell for
you
Oh I should've been the one who's with you now
Should've been the one who's feeling proud
Girl I've failed you now
Should've read the signs in your eyes
Should've had the sense to realise
I've lost you now
I know I let you down, baby had to fool around
Oh I should've been the one who's with you now
Should've been the one who's feeling proud
I failed you now
I should've read the signs, baby should've realised
Oh I should've read the signs in your eyes
Should've had the sense to realise
I've lost you now
I know I let you down, baby had to fool around.

I Don't Stop Rappin like my first tapes
When I was broke, I used to sell em instantly (instantly)
One look, you could tell it was the pimp in me (pimp in me)
In eighty-nine, I went on tour with Eazy-E (Eazy-E)
A bunch of fine bitches tryin to sleep with me
Every night, sold out, turnin young hoes
Tell her baby, no doubt, stick this dick in yo' mouth
I smoked a lot of weed, I said a lot of rhymes
Always fucked up in niggaz bitches all the time
Now I'm ridin on twenties wearin nice clothes
but ain't nuttin like pimpin hoes, and ridin Vogues
I live a good life, in my pursuit of happiness
I'm so glad, to get to the point of havin this
opportunity, for you and me to pass it on

Me, Squeaky, Flex and J, on Saratoga Street
Smokin white boys, bumpin dopefiend beats
Eighty-eight, my pockets wasn't straight, but I was makin it
Niggaz like Lil' Tim was out there ballin sellin cakes n shit
I was right there, on the Mob Circle, writin raps
All about my snaps, tryin to put Ball and G on the map
Nowadays I own my shit and bone bad bitches
Kickin it with rich niggaz in rollers, and candy sixes
Deliverin hot shit like Pizza Hut for them hardcore thugs
Niggaz who pimp bitches and hit the highway with them drugs
Feel my flow, mix it in witcha chronic main
Dawg, I don't know why you tryin to leave this game
State to state, plenty hoes and plenty money to make
Writing raps, makin more than them niggaz movin weight
The game been good to me, and I know that muhfucka bless you
Thanks for passin game, now let's get out here and make this lootToo, Eightball, MJG

I won't stop rappin, I don't stop rappin
I got too much money bitch I can't stop rappin
We some presidential players, with money by the layers
Ain't nuthin you broke ass niggaz do that can fade us
I won't stop rappin, I don't stop rappin
I got too much money bitch I can't stop rappin
I drive fast cars, eat lunch by lakes
and meet a hundred different bitches when I drop new tapesTwo: MJG, TooI had to sacrifice, get things right
In this rap life, I paid my dues
Learn how to crawl, before I walk
Then I learned how to tie my shoes
Tryin crime, but it just didn't work for me
Matter of fact it did it worse for me
Gettin eyes scarred, bein weak one time ya hard
It can only do hurt to me
So I sucked up my peer pressure, and my pride
And realized that this rap shit was gon help me to survive
Stay alive, go with the flow but don't be no muhfuckin fool
Hell this music thing is all I got, I ain't makin straight A's in school
And ain't wind up to be dumber nigga, only to be different
So all the shit that you think we are, the shit that we isn't
When you raised up, where I come from, make it out is a blessing
Cause half the cats, where I come from, don't ever learn they lessons
My first love, even before I had a daughter, or a lady
was rappin, sweet lyrics, I love you, my baby
MJG, what you see, on TV, is fame
But the rapper I let loose almost anything, I love this gameI won't stop rappin, I don't stop rappin
I make too much money bitch I can't stop rappin
I live the fast life of a MC
and I sell a lot of records makin pimp beats
I could do a show tonight and make ten G's
Fuck til the mornin, sleep late and smoke weed
Three cars in my garage, truck in the driveway
I always, get my dick sucked on the highwayThree: Eightball, MJGMy way (pimp til I dieee) fuck a hoe
Unless that hoe is breakin me off some dough, to hit the studio
Blowin, niggaz ain't knowin, how far this shit is goin
I wrote all my shit, but niggaz always talkin bout what I owe them
But I'm gon' show them, real niggaz stand on they own ten toes
So I'ma make all the money, and try my best to fuck all these hoes
Friend or foe, a bitch or hoe, rich or po'
Eightball got flow, MJGHere comes the one they call the P-I, M-P, never will retire
The tree-high, green leaf, helps me to get higher
Eightball and MJG, Too, we all must be
the pimps of the industry, shit people pretend to be
Fuck so why should we, settle down
Leave the kitchen put the kettles down
Stop from fillin all you hoes
Give up the life of trues and vogues
Hell no, it ain't gon' happen, this shit too deep
So I hooked up with my comrades so we can all get rich, niggaYea yea, one time, for your motherfuckin mind
Pimp shit bitch
Eightball and MJG, now what you weigh me
Dawg in the house, slammin Cadillac do's, pimpin hoes
Nuthin but the real shit, nine-eight, for these tricks it's too late
It's that old school pimpin all the way from Memphis, to Oakland
Straight smokin baby, fryin em up fat
Atlanta to Houston, we still doin it like this
Yea, New York to L.A.
Beyitch!
Hah, that's right, Space Age forever, nigga
T-Mix on the funk
Dangerous Music, uhh
Suave House
I love that!




 "
Pop,5 Seconds Of Summer,Amnesia,"I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
I thought about our last kiss, how it felt the way you tasted
And even though your friends tell me you're doing fineAre you somewhere feeling lonely even though he's right beside you?
When he says those words that hurt you, do you read the ones I wrote you?Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?'Cause I'm not fine at allI remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

Like all of this was just some twisted dream

But these chemicals moving between us
Are the reason to start againNow I'm holding on for dear life
There's no way that we could rewind
Maybe there's nothing after midnight
That could make you stayBut now that I'm broken
And now that you know it
Caught up in a moment
Can you see inside?

'Cause I've got a jet black heart
And there's a hurricane underneath it
Trying to keep us apart
I write with a poison pen
But these chemicals moving between us
Are the reason to start againThe blood in my veins
Is made up of mistakes
Let's forget who we are
And dive into the dark
As we burst into color
Returning to life'Cause I've got a jet black heart
And there's a hurricane underneath it
Trying to keep us apart
I write with a poison pen
But these chemicals moving between us
Are the reason to start againThe blood in my veins
Is made up of mistakes
(To start again)
Let's forget who we are
And dive into the dark

Pop,5 Seconds Of Summer,Close As Strangers,"Six weeks since I've been away
And now you're sayin' everything has changed
And I'm afraid that I might be losing you
And every night that we spend alone
It kills me thinking of you on your own
And I wish I was back home next to youOh, everyday
You feel a little bit further away
And I don't know what to sayAre we wasting time
Talking on a broken line?
Telling you I haven't seen your face in ages
I feel like we're as close as strangers
Won't give up
Even though it hurts so much
Every night I'm losing you in a thousand faces
Now it feels we're as close as strangers

Pop,5 Seconds Of Summer,Permanent Vacation,"You say that I'm too complicated.
Hung up and miseducated.
Well I say 9 to 5 is overrated,
and we all fall down.I can't sleep cause my mind keeps racing.
And my chest hurts cause my heart keeps breaking.
I'm so numb and I can't stop shaking,
and we all fall down.Frustration, desperation.
You say you need some kinda medication.
Situation, no motivation.
Desperation, permanent vacation.

He'll give you the Goosebumps, but he's never lead me wrong

Pulling you in like you're gonna start kissing
Fooling around until you've lost all feeling

Lying here no fear of the darkness

And all these dreams I'm dreaming
Freaking me out I wish I knew the meaning

Pop,5 Seconds Of Summer,Out Of My Limit,"Back in high school we used to take it slow
Red lipstick on and high heel stilettos
Had a job downtown working the servo
Had me waiting in line couldn't even let go'Cause I never wanna be that guy
Who doesn't even get a taste
No more having to chase
To win that prizeYou're just a little bit out of my limit
It's been two years now you haven't even seen the best of me
And in my mind now I've been over this a thousand times
But it's almost over

Jumping off these fences
Finding another place to start againCracks in the sidewalk

Taking off like fire in the windI won't waste another day
Wishing this would fade away
Running and we're not looking backI want a little bit of California
With a little bit of London sky
I wanna take my heart to the end of the world
Fly away tonight

She told me to meet her there,
I can't afford the bus fare,
I'm not old enough for her,
I'm just waiting till I'm eighteenYou got me waiting in a queue,
For a bar I can't get in to,
I'm not old enough for you,
I'm just waiting 'till I'm eighteen
I'm so sick of waiting till I'm eighteen.

Don't wanna be a victim of authority
I'll always be a part of the minority
Save me from who I'm supposed to be
So tell me, tell me, tell me what you want from me,
I don't wanna be another social casualty.
(Social casualty)Just a girl turned 18
She ran away to chase her dreams.
And they said she wouldn't make it far.
She took a chance and packed her bags
She left town and didn't look back
So tired of wishing on the stars.

We'll never be as young as we are now
It's time to leave this old black and white town
Let's seize the day
Let's run away
Don't let the colours fade to grey
We'll never be as young as we are now
As young as we are nowOh whoa whoa oh, oh oh oh
Oh whoa whoa ohI see myself here in your eyes
Stay awake 'till the sunrise
I want to hold you hold you all night
I want to tell you that you're all mineI feel our hands intertwined
Hear our hearts beating in time
I need to hold you hold you all night
I need to tell you that you're all mine

Yeah!Na Na Na Na
Na Na Na Na Na
Na Na Na Na Na
Yeah!Eddie never went nowhere
He stayed at home and played his X-Box
He read too many comics
He watched too much TV
Then somehow it got around
That his parents would be out of town
And so they all decided
That he should have a party
Climbing through the windows
They were jumping off the roof
They were diving in the pool
Until he finally let loose

He said tonight ""I'm superhero
Watch me fly I'll never get low
And I won't come down again""
(No no no)
""Tonight I'm superhero
I'm about to lose my halo
I wanna do it again""He had never got any
But this is the night his luck would change
She wore those thick black glasses
But she was so sexy
Then they started throwin' bottles
Partied 'til they trashed the whole house
But he just didn't care though
Cause he was finally happy
She met him on the staircase
Clark Kent and Lois Lane
They started making out and it would never be the sameHe said tonight ""I'm superhero
Watch me fly I'll never get low
And I won't come down again""
(No no no)
""Tonight I'm superhero
I'm about to lose my halo
I wanna do it again""Neighbors came at midnight screaming,
""Turn that music down!""
They said, ""Where the hell is Eddie?""
He was nowhere to be foundHe said ""tonight I'm superhero
Watch me fly I'll never get low
And I won't come down again""He said ""tonight I'm superhero
Watch me fly I'll never get low
And I won't come down again""
(No no no)
""Tonight I'm superhero
I'm about to lose my halo
I wanna do it again""Na Na Na Na

Pop,5 Seconds Of Summer,Everything I Didn't Say,"Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa(This is everything I didn't say)Wait, don't tell me
Heaven is a place on earth
I wish I could rewind all
the times that I didn't
show you what you're really worth
(What you're really worth)The way that you held me
I wish that I'd put you first
I was wrong I admit
Numb from your kiss
While you were slipping through my fingertips

Taking every breath away
With all of the mistakes I've made
From all the letters that I've saved
This is everything I didn't say
I wish I could've made you stay
And I'm the only one to blame
I know that it's a little too late
This is everything I didn't sayWhoa Whoa Whoa Whoa
(This is everything I didn't say)Wake me up now
And tell me this is all a bad dream
All the songs that I wrote
All the wrongs that I hoped would erase from your memory(erase from your memory)
Holding onto a broken and empty heart
Flowers I should've bought
All the hours I lost
Wish I could bring it back to the start

No one but me knows you're insane
I feel so damn pathetic
My friends just don't get itCause you've got me under oath
Before you I was in a fucking rut
One day you're in the past
That night I ask you backIt started out just harmless fun
Now you've got me thinking you're the one
Cause if you wanna take me home
You know I'm ready to leave
You've got me under your spell
Please, don't set me free

It's not like you to be cold
Every night replayed over and over
You say things that I don't
You make me feel alone
Every night replayed over and overYou say it's no concern
And everything's alright
Sometimes we all get burnt
And then we try to hide
And I know, and I know, and I know
And I know we're wrong
We should have let things slide
