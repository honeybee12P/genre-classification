Hip-Hop,Keith Urban,Ripcord ,Gone Tomorrow (Here Today) ,"A child held up in the sky
To sunset youth, we say goodbye
But I won’t live with regret
Carpe Diem is the secret
‘Cause, it’s....

Gone tomorrow, here today
I ain’t gonna waste it
I ain’t gonna waste it
No, it’s gone tomorrow
But it’s here today
I won’t let it slip away

I feel the rush it’s kicking in
And I wish this night would never end
We’re never coming back around
Like shooting stars, we’re burning out
It’s...

Gone tomorrow, here today
I ain’t gonna waste it
I ain’t gonna waste it
No, it’s gone tomorrow
But it’s here today
I won’t let it slip away

I wanna feel, wanna touch the light
I look around for the friends that have gone and I’m
Reminded that it’s all just a fantasy
But we get to choose what we wanna believe
And I wanna believe that there’s something more
Another level to the dream, right through the door
But right now’s for real and it’s fading fast
Better live ‘cause we’re never gonna to get it back

It’s...
Gone tomorrow, here today
I said, it’s gone tomorrow but it’s here today
I won’t let it slip away"
Hip-Hop,Keith Urban,Ripcord ,Wasted Time ,"The rain is coming down tonight
I'm smiling looking at this photograph
I hear that song and I'm flying right back
To when we had it made
Every Friday night when the sun went down
We'd be running them streets like we owned the town

And I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
Seven kids on my two lane road
Had the guns on the radio
After all this time it still feels, feels so good

When I think about those summer nights
Singing out the window, on the back roads, Sweet Child of Mine
Sipping on the local's spark of light
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time, all that wasted time

Out of nowhere, it slipped away
And the rope by the river hangs silently
And the town that I knew ain't nothing like it used to be
Ah, I can't explain
They took all the color from the picture frame
And the days got sold to the (?) and the game

And I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
Seven kids on my two lane road
We had the guns on the radio
After all this time it still feels, feels so good

When I think about those summer nights
Singing out the window, on the back roads, Sweet Child of Mine
Sipping on the local's spark of light
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time, all that wasted time
Swinging on the line
Living all that wasted time

Hey, hey, now
Summer dresses rained on the hood of the car
Only music that we had was out the left speaker
We were living every second 'til the time ran out
We had nothing but we had it all

When I think about those summer night
Sneaking out the window, running back roads
Your hand in mine
We were going nowhere, we were so alive
Uh huh, ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time, all that wasted time
We were swinging out on the line
Living all that wasted time

Hey, you know oh
All that wasted time
Don't you feel it coming on back now
Time, time, time"
Hip-Hop,Keith Urban,Ripcord ,Break on Me ,"There'll be days your heart don't wanna beat
You pray more than you breathe
And you just wanna fall to pieces
And nights, those 2 AM calls
Where dreams become walls
And you just need a break
Break on me

Shatter like glass
Come apart in my hands
Take as long as it takes, girl
Break on me
Put your head on my chest
Let me help you forget
When your heart needs to break
Just break on me

There'll be times when someone you know
Becomes someone you knew
But you'd do anything to change it
And words you wanna take back
But you know you can't
When the page just won't turn
And it still hurts
Break on me

Shatter like glass
Come apart in my hands
Take as long as it takes, girl
Break on me
Put your head on my chest
Let me help you forget
When your heart needs to break
Just break on me

Oh, when you need somebody
When you need somebody right now
You're where I'll be
Break on me

Shatter like glass
Come apart in my hands
Take as long as it takes, girl
Break on me
Put your head on my chest
Let me help you forget
When your heart needs to break
Just break on me
Break on me
Break on me, baby"

I ain’t never gonna worry ‘bout nothin’ again

Or a sleepy hometown with just one or two street lights lit
Where the blacktop dies and the gravel begins
Me and you skinny dippin’ where the river bends
Ain’t never gonna worry ‘bout nothin’ again
I ain’t never gonna worry ‘bout nothin’ again

Kickin’ back just a couple of sunshine hippies

Hip-Hop,Keith Urban,Ripcord ,That Could Still Be Us ,"Wide awake staring at my phone
Who's gonna give in first
We don't have to be all alone
We don't have to feel this hurt

Remember those nights in your driveway
Feelin' like the only ones left on Earth
And maybe I'm crazy
But I think that maybe

That could still be us...
Cause it still is sometimes at night, when my eyes are shut
Wish I could say it don't get to me
But it does...
And I know I probably think about you way too much 
But that's because
That could still be us

I went down to the river bank
Looked in the water and saw your face
That small town, summer wind
Whispers on my mistakes

Remember those nights in your backyard 
Making each other shake
And lately it kills me
And nothin' can fill me

Cause that could still be us...
And it still is sometimes at night, when my eyes are shut
Wish I could say it don't get to me
But it does...
And I know I probably think about you way too much 
But that's because
That could still be us

That could still be us
Oh, that could still be us
That could still be us

Tail lights fading in the dark 
I should've called out your name
I go by this night time park
And replay all again

What would've been
We should've been 
What was 

That could still be us...
And it still is sometimes at night, when my eyes are shut
I wish I could say it don't get to me
But it does...
And I know I probably think about you way too much 
And that's because
That could still be us

That could still be us
That could still be us
Oh, yeah
Oh, that could still be us
That could still be us"
Hip-Hop,Keith Urban,Ripcord ,Your Body ,"All the burnin’ lights
Go rushin’ by
I’m drivin’ like a wild man outta the city
Gotta leave the madness behind
This jungle world gets so insane
It’s a damned if you do
Damned if you don’t kinda deal
In this crazy game

Shinin’ in the darkness
Brighter than the sun
You fall into me
And we are one

And everything in the world is right
Stars align whenever my body
Is touching your body
And when I got your skin on mine
Fear gives way to heaven inside me
Whenever my body is touching your body

Your slight of hand
And your fire lips
Like a man with a habit
All I know’s I gotta have it
Yeah, the magic in your fingertips
The things you do
And the love we make
Underneath the covers
You carry me away

And everything in the world is right
Stars align whenever my body
Is touching your body
And when I got your skin on mine
Fear gives way to heaven inside me
Whenever my body is touching your body

They say, nothing lasts forever
We make that so untrue
When forever’s come and gone
I’ll still be holding on to you

And everything in the world is right
Stars align whenever my body
Is touching your body
And when I got your skin on mine
Fear gives way to heaven inside me
Whenever my body is touching your body"

Once upon a time, four wheels rolled and a

Boy gets a truck, truck gets a girl
Girl gets a midnight feeling he’s the one
One night turns to love
Love turns into one knee down
Down payment on a 3 bedroom house
Filled with the sound of little feet
Then you blink and he’s asking for the keys to pick her up
Boy gets a truck, truck gets a girl

It’s freedom flying down a two-lane
Young love steaming up the windows
‘Cause it can’t wait
She's whispering in your ear
While you're tryin’ to keep it on the road
It’s been goin’ on for years

Put her head on your shoulder
While the wheels keep turnin’ the world

Made you scared of love, too scared to love
He didn't deserve you

Fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, I’m not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away

When The Stars Come OutChris Stapleton

I was looking for a change of scene
You were looking at a magazine
It was red carpets and limousines
And the grass seemed so much greener
All we wanted was to get there fast
So, we packed up everything we had
Running on hope and a tank of gas
Like dreams ain't just for dreamers
We couldn't wait to leave that life behind
Trying to find salvation in that city limit sign

And one of those LA nights
When the stars come out
Oh, the stars come out and shine
And they burn so bright
They drown the downtown lights
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out

Everybody's, somebody, someday
Everybody's got a part to play
Everybody's trying to find a way
To say, what needs saying
Everybody's got a friend of a friend
Somebody that can get you in
Begging angels for a sin
In a game that we're all playing
You and I, we're gamblers holding cards that we can't see
And I'm betting on you, you're betting on me

Down on the freeway, the sun is out of sight
And I got a feeling tonight might be the night
Yeah, tonight might be the night"
Hip-Hop,Chris Stapleton ,Traveller ,Tennessee Whiskey ,"Used to spend my nights out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love I've known
But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom
And brought me back from being too far gone

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

I've looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of a bottle always dry
But when you poured out your heart I didn't waste it
‘Cause there's nothing like your love to get me high

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time
{Break}
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
Honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time
You're as sweet as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee Whiskey
Tennessee Whiskey
You're as sweet as Tennessee Whiskey
Tennessee whiskey

Hip-Hop,Chris Stapleton ,Traveller ,Sometimes I Cry ,"There are days that I can walk around like I'm alright,
And I pretend to wear a smile on my face,
And I could keep the pain from comin' out of my eyes,
But sometimes, sometimes,

Sometimes I cry,
Cry,
Sometimes I cry,
When I can't do nothing else.

Everybody keeps tellin' me to move on,
Oh but I can't seem to go anywhere without you,
Cause ever since, and every single night you been gone,
Sometimes, sometimes,

Sometimes I cry,
Cry,
Sometimes I cry,
When I can't do nothing else

Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I cry
When I can't do nothing else."
Hip-Hop,Chris Stapleton ,Traveller ,The Devil Named Music ,"[Verse 1]
We drove all night to Billings, Montana
Flew into Utah, slept there all day
I can’t remember stopping in Denver
Yeah, I live my illusion that somebody needs me to play

[Chorus 1]
Sometimes I’m drunk
Sometimes I’m stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
I miss my son
I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life

[Verse 2]
Now I sold my soul a long time ago
I put it in a six string and a sad melody
And I’m sometimes a winner, most times a loser
If the crowd gets into it, it’ll all feel the same way to me

[Chorus 2]
Sometimes I’m drunk
Sometimes I’m stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
I miss my daughter
I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life

[Chorus 1] + [Chorus 2]"
Hip-Hop,Chris Stapleton ,Traveller ,Was It 26 ,"[Verse 1]
Livin' hard was easy when I was young and bullet-proof
I had no chains to bind me, just a guitar and a roof
Emptied every bottle, when I poured I never missed
I had blood shot eyes at twenty-five or was it twenty-six
Didn't seem to matter what price I had to pay
Cause anything worth havin', I’d just lose anyway
Friends worried about me they’d asked if I was sick
Thought I wouldn’t die at twenty-five or was it twenty-six

[Chorus]
Those two years run together like whiskey over ice
Melted into memories like somebody else's life
I’m glad to say, I’ve come around
But if I could have one wish
I’d like another try at twenty-five
Or was it twenty-six

[Verse 2]
Met a girl from Georgia, smart and pretty, college grad
I thought my luck was changin' but then it all went bad
I guess I fell in love with her all it took was just one kiss
But then she said goodbye at twenty-five or was it twenty-six

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I've been down that road before almost as far as hell
Deception or redemption, I guess only time will tell
I have faith and the knowledge that God gave us a gift
I couldn't hide at twenty-five or was it twenty-six

[Chorus]"
Hip-Hop,Chris Stapleton ,Traveller ,Might As Well Get Stoned ,"[Verse 1]
Well, she said, she didn’t love me
And kicked me out the door
Now I’m livin’ in one room
And sleepin’ on the floor
Think I’m gonna kick my boots off
And put some music on
And since I’m all alone
I might as well get stoned

[Chorus]
I might as well get stoned
Get it off my mind
Ain’t got a thing to do
All I’ve got is time
The bottle’s all I’ve had to be a friend of mine
And since my whiskey’s gone
I might as well get stoned

[Verse 2]
Now every time I watch the TV
Another soldier dies
Another brother’s gone
Another mother cries
Now I know they’ve got a job to do
But if I had one wish
I wish they’d all come home
So, we could all get stoned

[Chorus]"
Hip-Hop,Chris Stapleton ,Traveller ,Daddy Doesn't Pray Anymore ,"[Chorus]
Daddy doesn’t pray anymore
I guess he’s finished talking to the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesn’t pray anymore

[Verse 1]
I remember even when the times were bad
He thanked Jesus for everything he had
For a good wife and three children
And the food upon our plates
Yeah, everything was right when he said, grace

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
There was a time when we didn’t get along
Cause I thought I was right and he was wrong
Still when I laid down at night
I’d hear him get down on his knees
And say a little prayer for me

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Today I followed daddy down to church
And listened to the preacher read God’s word
We sang his favorite hymn but daddy didn’t make a sound
This afternoon we’ll lay him in the ground
But daddy doesn’t pray anymore
I guess he’s finally walking with the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesn’t pray anymore"
Hip-Hop,Chris Stapleton ,Traveller ,More Of You ,"[Verse 1]
When I think of you and the first time we met
And I heard the sound of your sweet gentle voice
My heart took me over and gave me no choice
And right then I knew

[Chorus]
It makes me want more of you
Again and again
I fall more in love with you
Than I’ve ever been
From the moment you wake me up
Till you kiss me goodnight
Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you

[Verse 2]
When I look at you now that years have gone by
I think of the memories that time can’t erase
And all of the smiles that you’ve brought to my face
You’re love’s been so true

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
When I leave this earth you’ll be holding my hand
And it gives me comfort to know you’ll be there
And I’ll thank the Lord for the love that we share
You’re heaven to me

[Outro]
Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you"
Hip-Hop,Chris Stapleton ,Traveller ,Nobody To Blame ,"[Verse 1]
She took down the photograph
Of our wedding day
Ripped it down the middle
And threw my half away
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me
She broke all my fishing rods
Put my guns in hock
Threw my clothes out in the yard
And changed out all the locks
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

[Chorus]
I know right where I went wrong
I know just what got her gone
Turned my life into this country song
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

[Verse 2]
She fired up my old hot rod
Ran it in the pond
Put sugar in my John Deere
I can’t even mow my lawn
And I got nobody to blame but me
She built her a bonfire
With my old six string
Took all my good whiskey
And poured it down the drain
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

[Chorus]"
Hip-Hop,Chris Stapleton ,Traveller ,Whiskey And You ,"[Verse 1]
There’s a bottle on the dresser by your ring
And it’s empty so right now I don’t feel a thing
And I’ll be hurting when I wake up on the floor
But I’ll be over it by noon
That’s the difference between whiskey and you
Come tomorrow, I can walk in any store
It ain’t a problem, they’ll always sell me more
But your forgiveness
Well, that’s something I can’t buy
There ain’t a thing that I can do
That’s the difference between whiskey and you

[Chorus]
One’s the devil, one keeps driving me insane
At times I wonder if they ain’t both the same
But one’s a liar that helps to hide me from my pain
And one’s the long gone bitter truth
That’s the difference between whiskey and you

[Verse 2]
I’ve got a problem but it ain’t like what you think
I drink because I’m lonesome and I’m lonesome ‘cause I drink
But if I don’t break down and bring it on myself
It’ll hit out of the blue
That’s the difference between whiskey and you

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Ah, that’s the difference between whiskey and you"
Hip-Hop,Chris Stapleton ,Traveller ,Parachute ,"[Verse 1]
Street lights along the highway
Throwing shadows in the dark
And the memories keep on turning
To the rhythm of a broken heart

[Chorus]
You only need a roof when it’s raining
You only need a fire when it’s cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And falling feels like flying till you hit the ground
Say the word and I’ll be there for you
Baby, I will be your parachute

[Verse 2]
There’s a song that I remember
I never learned to play
And a lifetime of forgotten words
I never got to say

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
If you think you’re going down
Just know I will be around

Ten minutes from the beach

Screaming while I pitch

Beating deep on the speakers
Finally riding around the town
With my best friends, ain't life like a whirlwind
One second I'm playing checkers with Grandma
Then my world ends
I used to hear my granddaddy say
Before it's too late

Show some love back to your hometown
Fall in love, plant some seeds
Carve some names in the family tree
Raise your kids, love your wife

And get a little more dirt on my boots
You gotta dig your roots

Yeah,a good ol' boy, just like my old man
Every night when I'm singing
I know he's looking down
Up there next to PawPaw
Got the best seats in the house
When I close my eyes I can still hear him say
The same thing I'm gonna tell my kids

You gotta dig your roots

Made me a better man

Tryin' to be a good girl, but fallin' for a bad boy
Tryin to be a good girl, but fallin' for a bad boy

Well she's sundress cotton, he's grease on a Carhartt shirt
She's a candle in the wind, he's a light it up and let it burn
And every time she's with him all she wants to do is kiss him
Starts thinkin' maybe she can fix him and he's thinkin' he'd love to let her try

Faded double yellow lines on a two lane
I wish you were on it

I could use a little you right now
Rushing over runnin into my house 
With want you back tears rollin down your face
Drop your keys on my hardwood floor
Kiss me like you've never kissed me before
And girl I swear that's all that it would take
And you know the way
I wish you were on it

There's a parking lot, under the sycamore
And a flood light on the front porch
I wish you were on it

And through the front door, up the staircase
Theres a 4 post down the hallway
I wish you were on it

I could use a little you right now
Rushing over runnin into my house

That Sunday morning choir calling, church doors open wide
That hallelujah, shoot right through ya, make you feel alive

It's waiting with the porch light on
Don't bother calling, no need for knocking, just come on home
Come on home, my love is

Up with you all night, holding you all night, I never leave
You better believe my love is

So we can catch up on those stories
That we ain't got to yet
And while he's still around
I'm gonna make a couple of notes
About how's love my mother
Since all those years ago

Cause you never know when the phone is gonna ring
Sayin' heaven had it out to make you wings
And all those things that you were gonna do
Are just tear drops rainin' on a church pew
So I'm gonna try to say before I gotta pray it
Hopin' that he's lookin' down
And tell him that I love him
While he's still around

While he's still around
We're gonna fix up that old car
So one day when it's all mine
He'll be there every time it starts
And while he's still around
I want to meet the one
Watch him try and hold them tears back
When I see him holdin' my son

Cause you never know when the phone is gonna ring
Sayin' heaven had it out to make you wings
And all those things that you were gonna do
Are just tear drops rainin' on a church pew
So I'm gonna try to say before I gotta pray it
Hopin' that he's lookin' down
And tell him that I love him
While he's still around

I'm gonna try and catch a game with him
Take a road trip, get on out of state with him
Thank every memory I can make with him
Live it up before it's too late with him

Cause you never know when the phone is gonna ring
Sayin' heaven had it out to make you wings
And all those things that you were gonna do

Hip-Hop,Florida Georgia Line,Dig Your Roots ,Grow Old ,"Tell me that you love me
Say ""we'll always work it out""
I know it's kinda scary
But it's only temporary doubt 
I've done a lot of stupid things
But promise that you're gonna stay long enough to grow old with me
We're gonna see the good times love each other through the bad
It's gonna hurt like hell when we lose our moms and dads 
So let my shoulder hold your tears
Walk beside me through the years
Baby let's see, where this love could lead

Let's hold hands on your favorite beach
Fix up a house that we found in the city limits
Tangled up in a satin sheet
And get a little loud when we've had to much to drink
And learn to love from a church pew
Laugh about all the times we counted pennies
Buy some land with a good view
To start a family
Baby grow old with me

It's gonna take a little time we'll have to work at it everyday
We're gonna lose a lot of sleep and learn to eat out of a microwave
You know we'll probably never have it all
But that's part of building up the walls strong enough to stand up through the rain

We'll make some love on your favorite beach
And at the house that we found in the city limits 
Talk our babies through the bad dreams
When they get a little older we'll tell them not to drink 
Book a church when she finds a groom
Laugh about all the times they'll count the pennies
Give them land with a good view
To start a family

And baby you know we might take a turn down a backroad, maybe go where the wind blows baby,
but end up right where we were meant to be
Back and forth on a porch swing
Hard not to smile thinking how it don't get much better
Our babies, babies turning 18
What a family 
Baby grow old with me [x3]
Tell me that you love me
Say ""we'll always work it out"""

Hip-Hop,Sam Hunt,Montevallo ,Raised on It ,"Snap backs and levi jeans,
pbr and burnt CDs
Running for the grass on the hot concrete
Still working on our summer feet

Cheap gas and ready ice,
Trunk music and headlight fights
Dodging smoke from a riverbank fire
Pretty girl and a pickup line like
""Hey what's your name, you know smoke follows beauty baby""
We stayed up all night long
Made our drinks too strong
Feeling ten feet tall
Ropes swinging into the water
In the middle of the night
Like oh-oh-oh oh oh
Breaking our boots in
Stompin' in the ground we grew up on
Yeah, we were raised on it

Worked hard and played on it
We had it made on it
We were born and raised on it

Car wash at the custom tent
Sticky quarters and pine tree scent
The only sign that we ever got stuck

Is the muddy chain in the back of the truck 5-1's with a 20 on top
Three guard at the barber shop
Duckin' from your ex at the 4 way stop
Turn the music down when you're passing the cops

We stayed up all night long
Made our drinks too strong
Feeling ten feet tall
Ropes swinging into the water
In the middle of the night
Like oh-oh-oh oh oh
Breaking our boots in
Stompin' in the ground we grew up on
Yeah, we were raised on it

Mama's prayer and daddy's speech
Front porch philosophies
A Little too young and dumb to see
Just what it all meant to me

We stayed up all night long
Made our drinks too strong
Feeling ten feet tall
Ropes swinging into the water
In the middle of the night
Like oh-oh-oh oh oh
Breaking our boots in
Stompin' in the ground we grew up on
Yeah, we were raised on it"

T-shirt for a pillow, music up real low, creeping through the window
I can feel the bass line in the bed liner, and your heart on mine
tryin' to jump up out of your chest.

Baby you're now on fire, girl you're on fire
Out in the dark, wrapped up in the stars
So right, girl I'm so high
You and me, wild and free
Way out in the woods no body for miles
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
just us and the speakers on
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
just us and the speakers on

The moonlights tracing those tree tops across your face
There's a feeling in your eyes the shadows can't erase
The cool wind around us is breezing around us
following my fingers through your hair
The engine is idling and girl this heat lightning is flashing
pictures of you and burning them in my head

And I'm on fire, girl you're on fire
Out in the dark, wrapped up in the stars
So right, girl I'm so high

Go on and tell me baby, don't act like you can't say it
I know your body language, you ain't gotta translate it
Let it talk to me, till I can't take it
Your lips, your hair, your smile, your touch, your kiss, your stare
your vibes too much
It lights me up, you got me set
I'm way too gone, so baby let your eyes close
Say my name and watch me goin' up in flames

Girl I'm on fire, girl you're on fire
Out in the dark, where the wild things are
So right, girl I'm so high

Came pulling up
And I thought

Going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that
Running for it
Would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
And you were so
Innocent
But you were stealing my heart

Man, they weren't playin
They sure threw those cuffs on quick
You tried to sweet talk 'em
They didn't fall for it
But I did
You were on the left
I was on the right
I knew you didn't smoke
When you asked him for a light
And I laughed
He got mad and slammed the door

Side by side
And locked in tight
They were taking their time
But we didn't mind

We talked
And we laughed
We sat real close
By the time they let us go
I was already gone

Make you wish that you were sleeping in my shirt
Lie about my jacket and tell everyone its yours
When your phone rings after midnight and you're thinking maybe it's me
Gunna make you miss me

You're cold and hot
You burn out like a match
Keep the slip knot and the strings you attach
You think it's easy, but that's a lie
The only reason that you're good at goodbye is
Every boy you ever met, was to easy to forget
Well, I ain't going out like that

Hip-Hop,Sam Hunt,Montevallo ,Single For the Summer ,"The new years getting older, the February roses are withered away
The sun keeps getting closer, sinking a little slower everyday
Ooo it's getting louder at the lights, music clashing in the street, moon shining on the parking lot daws
Tanned legs in the nights, sliding out of the sea, stilettos at the crosswalk
I graduated but every year in May I get that ‘schools out' feeling
I feel it creeping in, every day's a weekend and I'm drowning in the freedom

Blame it on the bikinis, party girls, and martinis and the sunshine
Private school daughters that never go under water keeping their hair just right
I know in September, I'm gon remember how much i love her
I'm single for the suh-uh-uh single for the summer
I've gone off the deep end, the company of keeping is messing me up
The good girls at home sleeping, while I'm out creeping til the sun comes up
Ooo i've got my phone faced down, and my hair combed back, riding round getting good at the game
Saying the wrong things right, chasing midtown girls holding hands and forgetting their names
I graduated but every year in May I get that ‘schools out' feeling
Don't wanna leave her, but damn it I'm not a cheater and I can't help leaving

Blame it on the bikinis, party girls, and martinis and the sunshine
Private school daughters that never go under water keeping their hair just right
I know in September, I'm gon remember how much I love her
I'm single for the suh-uh-uh single for the summer
All of these pretty young thangs (pretty young thangs)
Can make you forget a goodbye sad
Try to make a good guy bad

Blame it on the bikinis, party girls, and martinis and the sunshine
Private school daughters that never go under water keeping their hair just right
I know in September, I'm gon remember how much I love her
I'm single for the suh-uh-uh single for the summer
I'm single for the suh-uh-uh single for the summer
Why do I love all of these city girls
Why do I love all of these city girls
Why do I love all of these city girls with pretty eyes
Down on the money and Broken hearted rich girls, the debutants, the small town runaways
All dolled up at the bar, with debit cards, they don't know how pretty they are

And you're not looking for anything right now

Tryin to pick you up
Trying to get you drunk

And I'm sure one of your friends is about to come over here
Cuz she's supposed to save you from random guys
That talk to much and wanna stay too long
It's the same old song and dance but I think you know it well

You coulda rolled your eyes
Told me to go to hell
Coulda walked away
But your still here
And I'm still here
Come on let's see where it goes

I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time

I don't have to meet your mother
We don't have to cross that line
I don't wanna steal your covers
I just wanna take your time

I don't wanna go home with you

I just wanna be alone with you

I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time

I don't wanna blow your phone up
I just wanna blow your mind
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time

No, I ain't gotta call you baby
And I ain't gotta call you mine
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time"
Hip-Hop,Sam Hunt,Montevallo ,Ex To See ,"Well there ain't enough smoke in my eyes
To hide the kinda games you're trying to play
Honey don't you act so surprised
You know exactly what I'm bout to say
You kiss my lips, like you mean it
But you ain't that slick

Everywhere we go you keep looking around
Fixing your make up like its about to go down
And he walks in, it all makes sense
Suddenly you're climbing all up next to me, next to me
I ain't no fool, you rascal you
You don't want me, you just want your ex to see, ex to see
Woahh woahhh woahh ohhh

So thats why when I pick you up
You always want me to drive your car
So I can leave mine at your house
And he can wonder where you are
You're right here
Looking sexy whispering in my ear

Everywhere we go you keep looking around
Fixing your make up like its about to go down
And he walks in, it all makes sense
Suddenly you're climbing all up next to me, next to me
I ain't no fool, you rascal you
You don't want me you just want your ex to see, ex to see
Woahh oh woah oh woah ohhh oh

Girl you look kinda cute, called out
You're making it hard to have hard feelings for you now
So hey, did he really do you wrong
Hmm
I guess I can play along
I guess I can play along
He walks in, it all makes sense
Suddenly you're climbing all up next to me, next to me
I ain't no fool, you rascal you
Girl come here and kiss me
I just want your ex to see
Woahh oh woah oh woahhh
I just want your ex to see
Ex to see, ex to see"
Hip-Hop,Sam Hunt,Montevallo ,Break Up In a Small Town ,"I knew I'd see her around
I'd be at some party, she'd show up and I'd be walking out
Or across some parking lot hiding behind her sister
I'd look up, she'd be at the red light beside me
In that white Maxima with the sticker on the back
I'd act like I didn't see her
We'd pay at the same pumps
Flip through the same stations
And slow down for the same curves
Run around with the same crowds
We just needed some time
She could get on with her life and I'd get on with mine
Thought I would be fine, heh, but maybe not
I knew she'd find a way to get over me
But I'd never thought that...

She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around
But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town

For a while I guess they were keeping it low-key
But now it's like these county lines closing in on me
I see 'em everywhere together
And it's hitting a little too close to home
She's so far gone, she didn't go far
She was over me before the grass grew back where she used to park her car
She's leaving those same marks in someone else's yard
In someone else's arms right down the road
And I never thought that...

She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around
But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town

Your mailbox is seven minutes from mine
And I drive into town sometimes I see you sittin' there with him
And I wanna jump out
I wanna fight
I wanna say, ""... that guy!"" but I can't
It's my fault, I let her go
I never thought that...

She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around
But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town"
Hip-Hop,Sam Hunt,Montevallo ,Leave the Night On ,"They roll the sidewalks in this town
All up after the sun goes down
They say nothin' good happens here
When midnight rolls around
But layin' down would be in vain
I can't sleep with you on my brain
I ain't anywhere close to tired
Your kiss has got me wired

Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your lovin's got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old train

We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on
Now all the stars are turnin' blue
Just kissed the clock 2: 22
Baby, I know what you're wishin' for

I'm wishin' for it too
Now all the lights are flashin' gold

Nobody cares how fast we go
Our soundtrack's in the stereo
This DJ's on a roll
Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your lovin's got me buzzin' like a streetlight

It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane

The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old train

We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on
The sun'll steal the magic from us soon
So let's take one more trip around the moon
Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your lovin's got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter all around us like some old train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
Babe we ain't gotta go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on"
Hip-Hop,Thomas Rhett,Tangled Up ,Learned It From the Radio ,"How to be proud of that town
that aint nobody heard of
had a big dream 17
someday how to grow up
how to make dust fly
out on a no named road
I learned it from the radio
how to wake up
how to work tough
how to roll up those sleeves
how to throw down
how to get loud
what to put in that drink
give the stars in the sky
a little halo
yea, I learned it from the radio
If it wasnt for
the speakers in the door
telling me a truth I havent
really heard before
I would had never kissed that girl
Never known what to say
I would had never known better
i'll let her get away
thank God for 4 wheel drive
thank God for windows down
and all the DJ's in all
those little static towns
how to live, how to love
every thing I needed to know
I learned it from the radio
What to say when you think
that you found that girl
who to call when shes gone
and she wrecks your world
how to get over it
how let her go
I learned it from the radio
How to see it all
from a front pourch
and how to say it all
just using 3 cords
and when to run
when your young
when to come back home
I learned it from the radio
If it wasnt for
the spearkers in the door
telling me the truth
I havent neverd heard before
I would had never kissed that girl
Never known what to say
I would had never known
better I'd let her get away
thank God for 4 wheel drive
thank God for windows down
and all the DJ's in all
those little static towns
How to live, How to love
everything I needed to know
I learned it from the radio
from the radio
I learned it form the radio
back to when we used to burn it
turn it up up up up
If it wasent for the speakers in the door
telling me a truth
I havent never heard before
I would had never kissed that girl
Never known what to say
I would had never known better
I would had let her get away

Hip-Hop,Thomas Rhett,Tangled Up ,Crash and Burn ,"So I guess it's over baby
Déjà vu again
Who'd have thought that time don't stop
And somehow girl, the world keeps spinning
I guess I've turned myself into a solitary man
Ain't like I'm the only one

That's in the shoes that I am
Do you hear that
I'm right back
At the sound of lonely calling
Do you hear that
It's where I'm at
It's the sound of teardrops falling down, down

A slamming door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn
I know that it might sound jaded
And I have to say
I think love is overrated

But I don't like throwing it away
I know you could probably tell me
Right where I went wrong
Some guys can't have all the luck
Do you hear that

I'm right back
At the sound of lonely calling

Do you hear that
It's where I'm at
It's the sound of teardrops falling down, down
A slamming door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn
That's right
Another lover
Another lover crash and burn
Ooooh yeah
Do you hear that
I'm right back
At the sound of lonely calling
Do you hear that
It's where I'm at
It's the sound of teardrops falling down, down
A slamming door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn
Yeah, I let another lover crash and burn

Hip-Hop,Thomas Rhett,Tangled Up ,Die a Happy Man ,"Baby last night was hands down
One of the best nights
That I've had no doubt
Between the bottle of wine
And the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain.

And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love
If I never get to see the Northern Lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man
Happy man, baby, hmmmm.

Baby and that red dress brings me to my knees
Oh but that black dress makes it hard to breathe
You're a saint, you're a goddess, the cutest, the hottest, the masterpiece
It's too good to be true, nothing better than you
In my wildest dreams.

And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all need in this life is your crazy love
If I never get to see the Northern Lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man, yeah.

I don't need no vacation, no fancy destination
Baby you're my great escape
We could stay at home, listen to the radio
Or dance around the fireplace.

And if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Or drive a sports car up the coast of California
Well if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man
Baby I could die a happy man
Oh I could die a happy man
You know I could, girl
I could die, I could die a happy man, hmmmm."

You say no way then you move in closer
Next thing I know you were in my T-shirt

You're moving around in the TV light

No way you wore my T-shirt, Yeah
You look good in my T-shirt, oh yeah

We be walking up the stairs
with the neighbors saying keep it down
But its hard to unblock the door when you're making out
You be saying that we gotta quit doing this
So why you leaning in for one more kiss
and pretty soon you're sliding off what you've got on
and slipping in to my T-shirt

right there your hair messed up like a Guns 'N Roses

You’re a saint, you’re a goddess, the cutest, the hottest
A masterpiece
It's too good to be true, nothing better than you
In my wildest dreams

[Pre-chorus: Tori Kelly & Thomas Rhett]
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett & Tori Kelly]
If I never get to see the Northern lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man yeah
Oh

[Verse 3: Thomas Rhett & Tori Kelly]
I don't need no vacation, no fancy destination
Baby you're my great escape
We could stay at home, listen to the radio
Or dance around the fireplace

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett & Tori Kelly]
And if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Or drive a sports car up the coast of California
Well if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die (oh) a happy man

[Outro: Thomas Rhett & Tori Kelly]
Baby I could die a happy man
Oh, I could die a happy man
Oh
You know I could, darling
I could die, I could die a happy man
I could die, yeah
Baby I could die a happy man"
Hip-Hop,Miranda Lambert,The Weight of These Wings ,Six Degrees of Separation ,"Thought that I was safe down in New Orleans
'Til I picked up a quarter from 1979
Stuck it in the back pocket of these jeans
Worn in boyfriend button down Levis
In the saints town I can't seem to figure out
How to get around, but I ain't moving on
Threw the quarter in an old street case
And I'll be damned, he started playing our song

Six degrees of separation
You're all over this damn nation
Well I'm out of your reach geographically
But you still find a way to get a hold on me
And it's six degrees of separation

Hailed a cab up in NYC
Saw an ad for a litigation lawyer on a bus stop bench
Sitting waiting for the red light to turn green
Smoke-breakers flirting on the steps of Merrill Lynch
Hit the Roosevelt, took it to the 12th
Got a funny feeling as I put my key in the door
Never seen the likes of these city lofts
I swear to god, son I've been here before

Six degrees of separation
You're all over this damn nation
I'm out of your reach geographically
You still find a way to get a hold on me
And it's six degrees of separation

Well, it's six degrees of separation
Yeah, it's six degrees of separation
Thought that I was safe down in New Orleans
'Til I picked up a quarter from 1979"
Hip-Hop,Miranda Lambert,The Weight of These Wings ,Vice ,"Stay as a needle dropping on a vinyl
Neon singer with a jukebox title full of heartbreak
33, 45, 78
When it hurts this good you gotta play it twice
Another vice

All dressed up in a pretty black label
Sweet salvation on a dining room table
Waiting on me
Where the numb meets the lonely

It's gone before it ever melts the ice
Another vice

Another call, another bed I shouldn't crawl out of
At 7AM with shoes in my hand
Said I wouldn't do it, but I did it again
And I know I'll be back tomorrow night, oh

I'll wear a tail like a leather jacket
When the new wears off, I don't even pack it
If you need me
I'll be where my reputation don't proceed me

Maybe I'm addicted to goodbyes
Another vice

Another town, where my past can't run me down
Another life, another call, another bed I shouldn't crawl out of
At 7AM with shoes in my hand
Said I wouldn't do it, but I did it again
And I know I'll be gone tomorrow night
Mmm, another vice

Standing at the sink now, looking at the mirror
Don't know where I am or how I got here
Well the only thing that I know how to find
Is another vice

Mmm another vice
Yes, another vice
Ooh, another vice
Another vice
Another vice
Another vice"
Hip-Hop,Miranda Lambert,The Weight of These Wings ,Keeper of the Flame ,"I'm walking in their footsteps
I'm singing their old songs
Somebody blazed this trail
I'm treadin' on
I'm bent, but I'm not broken
I'm stronger than I feel
I'm made of flesh and bone
Not made of steel

I'm the keeper of the flame
The teller of the story
Keeper of the flame
For the ones that came before me
For those little pilot lights, waiting to ignite
Like fireflies in the rain
Keeper of the flame

I've been burned out to ashes
Waiting for a wind
To carry me and start a fire again
Sometimes I'm just a flicker
A candle in your eye
But I swear to God
I'll never let it die

I'm the keeper of the flame
The teller of the story
Keeper of the flame
For the ones that came before me
For those little pilot lights, waiting to ignite
Like fireflies in the rain
Keeper of the flame

When I'm drowning
When I'm fighting
When I'm screaming
When I'm hiding
When I'm losing
When I'm winning
I go back to
The beginning

Keeper of the flame
The teller of the story
Keeper of the flame
I'm not doing it for the glory
But for those little pilot lights, waiting to ignite
Like fireflies in the rain
Keeper of the flame

I'm the keeper of the flame
Ooooh, oooh
I'm the keeper of the flame
Ooooh, oooh"
Hip-Hop,Miranda Lambert,The Weight of These Wings ,Runnin' Just in Case ,"There's trouble where I'm going, but I'm gonna go there anyway
I hate Sunday mornings cause they always seem to start this way

I'm looking for a lighter, I already bought the cigarettes
Guess I picked me up a habit on my way out of Lafayette

Eastbound and down
I turn it up cause thats sure how I feel

My mind is racing through the pines
My hands are shaky on the stirring wheel

I'm going north on 59, but I know good and well I'm heading south
Cause me and Birmingham don't have a history of working out

What I lost in Louisiana
I found back in Alabama
But nobody ever taught me how to stay
It ain't love that I'm chasing
But I'm runnin' just in case

I ain't unpacked my suitcase since the day that I turned 21
It's been a long ten years since then, It's getting kind of cumbersome

The first one, and the last one, and the one thats got my name in ink
The smoker, and the fighter, and the one in every song I sing

What I lost in Lubbock Texas
I look for in all the rest
But I guess no one ever taught me how to stay
It ain't love that I'm chasing
But I'm runnin' just in case

I carry them around with me, I don't mind having scars
Happiness ain't prison, but there's freedom in a broken heart

Hip-Hop,Miranda Lambert,The Weight of These Wings ,Ugly Lights ,"I don't remember when the liquor started kicking in
It's been awhile since I've been off the stuff

I really hate to say I'm turning into a cliche
I'm hoping that nobody brings it up

I left my car behind the bar again last Sunday night
I did the Monday morning drive of shame

In last nights clothes they smell like smoke
But I don't know how I got home
But I do know my head will hurt all day

But I'm still going to stay too late
And be the girl bartenders hate
The one that doesn't need another one
When the Romeo's and Juliet's have bummed all of my cigarettes
The last kiss in the parking lot is done
I'll be sitting here alone
When the ugly lights come on

Well everybody's got a spark
It's easy hiding in the dark
In a crowded room with pockets full of rings

I sit and watch the whiskey pour
The married men, the exit door
The beginning of another matchbook flame

And I don't try to justify the reason I'm not livin' right
I wear my sadness like a souvenir

I drink too much to fall apart
That's how I fight this broken heart
So what, if I feel comfortable in here

But I'm still going to stay too late
And be the girl bartenders hate
The one that doesn't need another one
When the Romeo's and Juliet's have fund all of my cigarettes
The last kiss in the parking lot is done
I'll be sitting here alone
When the ugly lights come on

Stop sign, stop sign

Won't you just send me some word

If your mind's as cluttered as your kitchen sink
If your heart's as empty as your diesel tank
If all your white t-shirts have stains
If you've got some guts and got some ink
Well then, we should be friends

If you borrow dresses like you borrow time
If you dream all day and drink all night
If you're looking for love but willing to fight
Over men and momma's and Miller Lite
Well then, we should be friends

I don't know you well but I know that look
And I can judge the cover 'cause I read the book
On losing sleep and gaining weight
On pain and shame and crazy trains

If you paint your nails while you cut your loss
If you like acting like you're the boss
If everything your daddy says
Is something you can put stock in
Well then, we should be friends

I don't know you well but I know that look
And I can judge the cover 'cause I wrote the book
On losing sleep and gaining weight
On pain and shame and crazy trains

One, two, three..

If you use alcohol as a sedative
And bless your heart as a negative
If you ride your white horse like the wind
If what you see is what you get
Well then, oh, we should be friends
(Alright)

Well then, oh, we should be friends
Well then, oh, we can be friends

Standing in the line of fire

Miles were the only thing that saved us
Headlights were our only traces
No rearview mirror, no looking back
Desert horizon as our map

And a deeper pocket with money to burn
I want a man who knows his status
And he makes a habit of loving me 'til it hurts

But he knows how to take it slow
He might be quite continental
But he's sure gonna take me home, yes he is

I want a man with a smoking jacket
And a car that's classic living bourgeoisie
I want a man who's heart is tragic
But he makes his magic every night on me

We go together just like nicotine and Chanel
And when he lights up I'm his Lucky Strike
Waiting for him to exhale

I want a man with a smoking jacket
And a deeper pocket with money to burn
I want a man who knows his status
And he makes a habit of loving me 'til it hurts

I don't need a diamond
I like wearing his smoke rings

I want a man, I want a man

I want a man

I want a man with a smoking jacket
And he lights his matches with kerosene

I want a man, I want a man
I want a man with a smoking jacket

Cause I already dread the end.
Lonely ain't no place to start;
I guess that's just where we are.
Oh how I remember well
The sunset on September 12.
I disappeared to get a drink;
You still kept your eyes on me

Sometimes loves acts out of spite,
And good things happen over night.
Can't take it slow cause you and I are pushin time

I didn't plan on fallin' fast;
I didn't know I could be kissed like that.
No I'm tradin' miles for minutes.
This bed's too big without you in it.

Sometimes love acts out of spite,
And good things happen over night.
Can't take it slow cause you and I are pushin' time
You and I are pushin' time

And they say only time can tell,
You already know me well.
If it has to end in tears,
I hope that it's in sixty years.

Sometimes love acts out of spite,
And good things happen over night.
Can't take it slow cause you and I are pushin' time.
Can't take it slow cause you and I are pushin' time.

Or drive 200 miles on a rundown engine
Put a blanket underneath a hollow tree
When the wind blows hard it will fall on me
Stick around long enough and you will see

I'm not sure how you make a living
You can buy me one of whatever you're drinking
I'm thinking my mama warned me about your kind
Sure, you can light my cigarette
Don't think you can light my heart
Don't think I haven't figured you out from the start

Giving in to bad boys like you never got me very far
It's trouble now, baby drink it down
You should have seen it coming

Bad boy, driving me mad boy
I've got it bad boy, for you
Bad boy, maybe it's a bad choice
I've got it bad boy for you

The more I hear your silence speak
The more my curiosity peaks
The more I don't wanna leave this bar alone
The whisky's making me wonder why
You wear your hat down low, but your walls are high
How long you gonna hide behind them walls of stone?
Sure, you can buy me one more round
Don't think you can buy my heart
Don't think I haven't figured you out from the start

Giving in to bad boys like you never got me very far
It's trouble now, baby drink it down
You should have seen it coming

Bad boy, driving me mad boy
I've got it bad boy, for you
Bad boy, maybe it's a bad choice
I've got it bad boy, bad boy, for you

You should have seen it coming
Bad boy, driving me mad boy
I've got it bad boy, for you
Bad boy, maybe it's a bad choice
I've got it bad boy, bad boy
Bad boy, driving me mad boy
I've got it bad boy, bad boy

Hip-Hop,Miranda Lambert,The Weight of These Wings ,Six Degrees of Seperation ,"Thought that I was safe down in New Orleans
'Til I picked up a quarter from 1979
Stuck it in the back pocket of these jeans
Worn in boyfriend button down Levis
In the saints town I can't seem to figure out
How to get around, but I ain't moving on
Threw the quarter in an old street case
And I'll be damned, he started playing our song

Six degrees of separation
You're all over this damn nation
But I'm out of your reach geographically
But you still find a way to get a hold on me
And it's six degrees of separation

Hailed a cab up in NYC
Saw an ad for a litigation lawyer on a bus stop bench
Sitting waiting for the red light to turn green
Smoke-breakers flirting on the steps of Merrill Lynch
Hit the Roosevelt, took it to the 12th
Got a funny feeling as I put my key in the door
Never seen the likes of these city lofts
I swear to god, son I've been here before

Six degrees of separation
You're all over this damn nation
I'm out of your reach geographically
You still find a way to get a hold on me
And it's six degrees of separation

Well, it's six degrees of separation
Yeah, it's six degrees of separation

How you holding up
Through the winter cold
Up there all alone
February's been hard on a heart
But we're near the end
And it's almost march
Though the sky's been grey
And in our way I still see your light

Well, you melt the snow
And you grow the roses
And you dry the tears
And you freckle noses
Our little world
Revolves around you
Coming up and going down

Oooooo

Dear old sun
Lets call it a day
And I watch you set
I'll let you rest
But wait for you
At mornings due
Till I see your light

Oooooo

I still see your light
I still see your light
Heaven shining down tonight
I still see your light


I still see your light
I still see your light
Heaven shining down tonight

Get a little heavy

I'm rolling on

I can't count time
I can't count money

Whatever road, however long
I've got wheels
I'm rolling on

When I can't fly, I start to fall

I'll stay just long enough to catch my breath
This life with you will keep me strong

keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer

Nobody's ex is texting for a rewind

We were dying when they played it

He is watching over me
I feel the rain, I hear the thunder,
As he cries for me
I'm standing in my Savior's shadow,
Grace will lead to where I'm free
I take his hand, we walk together
And his light shines on me

Though the devil try to break me
My sweet Jesus won't forsake me
When I'm in my Savior's shadow
Where I'm supposed to be.

I'm standing in my Savior's shadow,
Following his footsteps there,
Every mountain, every ocean
Here's my every prayer

Though the devil try to break me
My sweet Jesus won't forsake me
When I'm in my Savior's shadow
Where I'm supposed to be.

Though the devil try to break me
My sweet Jesus won't forsake me
When I'm in my Savior's shadow

Hip-Hop,Jon Pardi,California Sunrise ,Out of Style ,"When I first got to Nashville town
They called me in and sat me down
And told me all about the ins and outs of writing songs
Said write about the things you know about
If there's anything that you don't know about
Just stick around and you'll find out before too long

So I pulled out my guitar and I put my pen to paper
Started working on the groove
They could move to all night long
Yeah, I poured out my heart soul
Strummed a chord, next thing you know
I looked down and I had this song

And it goes
Jesus saves and beers better cold
A good woman's made to love not just to hold
Monday through Friday sure takes awhile
We all get sideways and go that extra mile
The common ways we work and play
Are still alive and well today
Don't need to find a new way to say
We don't go out of style

It may never see a bullet
In a billboard magazine
But then I've never been the kind
To go out chasing smoking guns
All I know is all of us tonight
Know all the words and we're acting like
It'll be a week before the weekend's done

Singing, Jesus saves and beers better cold
A good woman's made to love not just to hold
Monday through Friday sure takes awhile
We all get sideways and go that extra mile
The common ways we work and play
Are still alive and well today

She was a 1960's Beach Boys song
And we're living that dream all night long

In that California sunrise
In that California sunrise
She took me to heaven and so much more
Like nothing I've ever seen before
In that California sunrise

Pretty soon it was raining up in Seattle
And it sure was cold out in Colorado
Yeah, I was missing her kiss in the heat of Arizona
Been everywhere and nothing could compare
Yeah, to that one of a kind trip I was on
Everything about her felt like home

In that California sunrise
In that California sunrise
She took me to heaven and so much more
Like nothing I've ever seen before
In that California sunrise
Take me on back

Found her number in a pocket of my blue jeans
Picked up the phone and let it ring
Said ""I'm counting down the miles back to you, babe""
Yeah, I'm heading west on a big old jet plane

To some old motown song

Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?

Hip-Hop,Brantley Gilbert,The Devil Don't Sleep ,We're Gonna Ride Again ,"That long gray beard hung down to his chest
Ol' long hair was always a mess
And the laugh on that man, I'll never forget
You could hear him from a mile away
Loved his Pabst Blue Ribbon and his cigarettes
He'd burn one down, light 'er up again
I still see that grin and that ol' H.D
He'd roll it like he stole the thing
You know, I talked to him yesterday
I asked him

How's that steel horse ride on the streets of gold?
Does the promised land have any ol' back roads?
Ain't a doubt you've done a burnout on a cloud
Knowin' you, you probably laid her down
Have you revved it up while the angels sang?
Did God get on ya, did He take your wings?
You better have 'em back 'fore I get in
'Cause brother, we're gonna ride again

Alright

They say blood makes you related
But loyalty makes you kin
So when I called that man my brother
Well, I meant what I said
'Cause we were thick as thieves and we were hell on wheels
I can't begin to tell ya how it feels
But I speak for us all, man it hurts like hell
We miss your smilin' face
We'll saddle up again one day
Until then

Hip-Hop,Brantley Gilbert,The Devil Don't Sleep ,Three Feet of Water ,"Got a whole lot of years
And a whole lot of pain
And it all got me here
Where the river meets the clay
Rewindin' through my past
Tryin to find some good
But I can't seem to see
What mama always could

And that sun is shinin' down
On all my darker days
They're comin' to me now
As I hear the preacher say
In the name of the Son and the Father
Can I really leave it all
In three feet of water?

I can't unbreak the laws
Straighten out the rules I've bent
Take the broken dreams and hearts
Make 'em all whole again
I been carryin' around
All the messes that I've made
But a few more steps from now
They'll all be washed away

And that sun is shinin' down
On all my darker days
They're comin' to me now
As I hear the preacher say
In the name of the Son and the Father
Who'd've thought I could leave it all
In three feet of water
Washin' over me
Amazing Grace the choir sings
And now I know what mercy's all about

And that sun is shinin' down
And all my darker days
They're nowhere to be found
All that preacher had to say
Was in the name of the Sun and the Father
Who'd've thought I could leave it all?
You took my cross so I could leave it all
In three feet of water
Mmm, in three feet of water
Mmm

So, it's that simple, huh?

Hip-Hop,Brantley Gilbert,The Devil Don't Sleep ,At Least We Thought It Was ,"Junior year you were A's and B's
Right on track
Homecomin queen
But the day we met
You had your heart set on that badboy thing
And your daddy swore I was trouble
So, I snuck you out to cuddle up
Next to me in that middle seat
We'd roll backroads, hold hands, and sing

We were Romeo and Juliet
Breakin out in a sweat
Makin out in the bed
Of a beat up truck
Slap covered in mud
You swore I was lyin'
I swore I was stuck
By the bare footprint on a fogged up window
A big ol' heart around our initials
We told all our friends
That it was love
And it was love
At least we thought it was

You had to wait 'til you turned 18
Earned that ring
Hit one knee
Just like we planned
Tried our hand at that old runaway thing
And I didn't know where I was goin'
But I remember your hair was blowin in the wind
I just knew it then
That what we had would never end

We were Bonnie and Clyde
Rollin' 95
Burnin treads on the tires
Barely a dime
Both our names musta gone insane
Thinkin' we'd get somewhere on half a tank
On the side and at the end of our road
With just enough cash to get you home
We believed all we'd ever need was love
And we had love
At least we thought it was

Love at first sight
I remember that first night
What a beautiful girl
But I grew up and now I see
It just wasn't meant to be
I think it was us against the world

We were Romeo and Juliet
Breakin' out in a sweat
Makin' out in the bed
Of a beat up truck
Slap covered in mud
You swore I was lyin'
I swore I was stuck

You don't light up the room the way you used to anymore
And I don't get butterflies, what are we fighting for?

Yeah, and I'm fighting temptation to fall out of love
And you know, girl you know
You're all out of patience, and I'm already gone

That if our love ain't far from the end
It's closer than we've ever been

And I've lost that old smile
You've lost that fire in your eyes
Yeah, when was the last time you wanted my touch on your skin?
Well I don't remember, I guess that's just how long it's been

Weather man says is gonna rain
And wearin' (?) won't change a thing
Yeah we still got plans tonight
We gonn' kick it, dancin', givin' baby rain or shine

Leave your Sunday best at home
Be last time you wear what you got on
Bikini top cut off jeans
Damn, baby girl you know you lookin' mean

She said ""how we gonna make it through the mudhole?""
Whatch ya think I got swampers on my truck for?

It's about to get dirty in the dirty south
'Bout to show you what it's all about
Don't worry, there's a rowdy crowd
We ain't scared, we still throwin' down

We gonna tap that keg
Locked at five
We gonna' crank that country
Pass out shots
And get thirsty

Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain
It's about to get dirty

There's just somethin' 'bout a good old flood
Watching that red clay turn to mud
Slinging up, slam past the doors
Like a new paint job on a 4x4

Girl you gonna have a good ol' time
Can't let a little bit of rain change your mind
Let your hair down, coffin boots?
For once in your life let yourself cut loose

Gonna get muddy from head to toe
Cleanin' off, skinny dipping in the swimming hole

It's about to get dirty in the dirty south
'Bout to show you what it's all about
Don't worry, there's a rowdy crowd
We ain't scared, we still throwin' down

We gonna tap that keg
Locked at five
We gonna' crank that country
Pass out shots
And get thirsty

Let it rain let it rain let it rain
It's about to get dirty

Girl your whole life's 'bout to change
Bad times and muddy water let me hear you say
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain

It's about to get dirty in the dirty south
'Bout to show you what it's all about
Don't worry, there's a rowdy crowd
We ain't scared, we still throwin' down

We gonna tap that keg
Locked at five
We gonna' crank that country
Pass out shots
And get thirsty

Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain
Everybody get thirsty
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain
Listen 'bout to get dirty
Listen 'bout to get dirty
C'mon

Middle of the night, I'm outside in your drive and baby let's go.
Didn't call or nothin', just showed up and told you ""East Diamond Road"".
Got you head over heels girl, ain't this a trip?
Just ridin' round, yeah you're lovin' this bad boy shit.

Hip-Hop,Brantley Gilbert,The Devil Don't Sleep ,In My Head ,"Well, I watched the sun come up on auburn hair across my chest
Couple coffee cups with just a little wine left
I had to smile 'cause you still got that bottle in your hand
Last night's a movie playin' over and over
All in my head
All in my head, baby
We talked for hours, fell in love with everything you said
About our exes, about Jesus in between some sips
You said so sexy, with your lips about an inch away
You wanna kiss me, don't you, whaddaya say
You're in my head
All in my head, baby

You got me thinkin' crazy, this ain't me, I know where it ends
And this has got too good to be true written all over it
I'm takin' this leap of faith, if I go down in flames
We made a memory that won't go away
You're in my head
All in my head, baby

You sleep so pretty up against me in this truck bed
Your little hand's inside of mine, and it's a perfect fit
And I'm in love with you all over me in every way
And I wouldn't be sayin' this if you were awake
You're in my head
All in my head, baby

You got me thinkin' crazy, this ain't me, I know where it ends
And this has got too good to be true written all over it
I'm takin' this leap of faith, if I go down in flames
We made a memory that won't go away
You're in my head
All in my head, baby

When you woke up, I saw you smile when you looked back at me
Said you missed me, I forgot how to breathe
You're in my head

What am I gon' do with you
You're in my head

You got me thinkin' crazy, this ain't me, I know where it ends
And this has got too good to be true written all over it

Tick tock, I'm on the clock and I'm feeling like
This job's just 9 to 5'in my life away
It's like I'm back in school and I'm in the last class
And I'm passing time until the bell ring
Havin' visions of summertime
Wait a minute now, that's just later tonight
Tan legs and tailgating, it's all up in the moonlight
And by the way, loosin' up its pay day

Live it up for the weekend
Pour it up, have the time of your life
Take a shot for the regrets
Double up and it's bound to get buck wild
Hey ladies, let your hair down
We know ain't nobody scared now, hell nah
Just do your thing like it's spring break
Wake and bake and we're at it again
We live it up for the weekend

Backwoods looking like Panama City
A bunch of jacked up trucks and bikinis
Got a Yeti full of good ideas
Like I ain't worried 'bout drivin, I'mma stay right here

And I'mma live it up for the weekend
Pour it up, have the time of your life
Take a shot for the regrets
Double up and it's bound to get buck wild
Hey ladies, let your hair down
We know ain't nobody scared now, hell nah
Just do your thing like it's spring break
Wake and bake and we're at it again
We live it up for the weekend

Somebody said something 'bout church on Sunday, amen
Somebody said something 'bout work on Monday
Shhh, don't say it again

Live it up for the weekend
Pour it up, have the time of your life
Take a shot for the regrets
Double up and it's bound to get buck wild
Hey ladies, let your hair down
We know ain't nobody scared now, hell nah
Just do your thing like it's spring break
Wake and bake and we're at it again
We live it up for the weekend

Live it up, live it up for the weekend

Oh, what I'd give if I could see.
Am I the boy that you care for,
The boy who's in your diary?

Do you recall and make note of all
The little things I say and do?
The name you underline, I'm hoping that it's mine.

I've seen the streets you're walking down
I'm fairly local, good people now, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm evil to the core, What I shouldn't do I will
They say I'm emotional, What I want to save I'll kill
Is that who I truly am?, I truly don't have a chance
Tomorrow I'll keep a beat, And repeat yesterday's dance
Yo, this song will never be on the radio
Even if my clique were to pick and the people were to vote
It's the few, the proud, and the emotional
Yo, you, bulletproof in black like a funeral

The world around us is burning but we're so cold
It's the few, the proud, and the emotional
I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets you're walking down
I'm fairly local, good people now,

I'm not evil to the core, What I shouldn't do I will fight
I know I'm emotional, What I want to save I will try

I know who I truly am, I truly do have a chance
Tomorrow I'll switch the beat, To avoid yesterday's dance
Yo, this song will never be on the radio
Even if my clique were to pick and the people were to vote
It's the few, the proud, and the emotional
Yo, you, bulletproof in black like a funeral
The world around us is burning but we're so cold

But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?

They think this thing is a highway
If it was a highway
We'd have a tempo change every other time change
Cause our minds change on what we think is good
I wasn't raised in the hood
But I know a thing or two about pain and darkness
If it wasn't for this music, I don't know how I would've fought this
Regardless, all these songs I'm hearing are so heartless
Don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless
Honest, there's a few songs on this record that feel common
I'm in constant confrontation with what I want and what is poppin'
In the industry it seems to me that singles on the radio are currency
My creativity is on the free when I'm playin' shows

They say ""stay in your lane boy, lane boy""
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?
Will they be alive tomorrow?

I'm sorry if that question I asked last
Scared you a bit like a hazmat, in a gas mask
If you ask Zack, he's my brother, he likes when I rap fast
But let's back track, back to this
Who would you live and die for on that list
But the problem is
There's another list that exist and no one really wants to think about this
Forget sanity, forget salary, forget vanity, my morality
If you get in between someone I love and me
You're gonna feel the heat of my calvary

All these songs I'm hearing are so heartless
Don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless

They say ""stay in your lane boy, lane boy""
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?
They say ""stay in your lane boy, lane boy""
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?

Will they be alive tomorrow?
(Will they be alive tomorrow?)
(Will they be alive tomorrow?)
Will they be alive tomorrow?

They say ""stay in your lane boy, lane boy""
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?
They say ""stay in your lane boy, lane boy""
But we go where we want to

Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind

Takin' my time on my ride.
""I'd die for you"" that's easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A bullet for them, a bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room
But I don't seem to see many bullets coming through
See many bullets coming through
Metaphorically, I'm the man
But literally, I don't know what I'd do
""I'd live for you"" and that's hard to do
Even harder to say, when you know it's not true
Even harder to write, when you know that's a lie
There were people back home who tried talking to you
But then you ignore them still
All these questions they're for real, like
""Who would you live for?""
""Who would you die for?""
And ""Would you ever kill?""

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, cause we have the same nose, same clothes, home grown, the stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and tree house homes, we all would take the latter

When the leader of the bad guys sang
Something soft and soaked in pain
I heard the echo from his secret hideaway
He must've forgot to close his door
As he cranked out those dismal chords
And his four walls declared him insane

Right time wrong place
As I pled my case

Three lights are lit
But the fourth one's out
I can tell cause it's a bit darker
Than the last night's bout
I forgot about the drought
Of light bulbs in this house
So I head out
Down a route I think is heading south
But I'm not good with directions
And I hide behind my mouth
I'm a pro at imperfections
And I'm best friends with my doubt
And now that my mind's out
And now I hear it clear and loud
I'm thinking, 'Wow
I probably should've stayed inside my house.'

In a state of emergency

And being blue is better than being over it

Let it move right through ya (hallelujah!)

Stop thinking about
The bullets from my mouth
I love the things you hate about yourself
Just finished a daydream
Who were you trying to be

Then the time for being sad is over
And you miss them like you miss no other
And being blue is better than being over it

No one wants you when you have no heart and
I'm sitting pretty in my brand new scars and
You'll never know if you don't ever try again
So let's try
Let's try

[Verse 1]
I found a pile of Polaroids
In the crates of a record shop
They were sexy, sexy looking back
From a night that time forgot
Boy, he was something, debonair in 1979
And she had Farrah Fawcett hair
Carafes of blood red wine

[Pre-Chorus]
In the summertime
In the summertime

[Chorus]
Oh don't you wonder when the light begins to fade?
And the clock just makes the colors turn to grey
Forever younger
Growing older just the same
All the memories that we make will never change
We'll stay drunk, we'll stay tan, let the love remain
And I swear that I'll always paint you

[Verse 2]
I bet they met some diplomats on Bianca Jagger's new yacht
With their caviar and dead cigars
The air was sauna hot
I bet they never even thought about
The glitter dancing on the skin
The decades might've washed it out
As the flashes popped like pins

[Intro]
Oh, the good, the bad, and the dirty
Oh, the good, the bad, and the dirty

[Verse 1]
Truth is that it was always going to end
This symphony buzzing in my head
Took a market of filth
And sold it like summer

True all of the good girls act so good
Til one of them doesn't wait their turn
Turn the memory to stone
And carve your shoulder
Hey holy roller

[Chorus]
If you wanna start a fight
You better throw the first punch
Make it a good one
And if ya wanna make it through the night
You better say my name like
The good, the bad, and the dirty
The good, the bad, and the dirty
The good, the bad, and the dirty

[Verse 2]
I know what it's like to have to trade
The ones that you love for the ones you hate
Don't think I've ever used a day of my education

There's only two ways that these things can go
Good or bad and how was I to know
That all your friends won't hold any grudges
I got the final judgement

[Chorus]
If you wanna start a fight
You better throw the first punch
Make it a good one
And if ya wanna make it through the night
You better say my name like
The good, the bad, and the dirty
The good, the bad, and the dirty
The good, the bad, and the dirty

[Bridge]
And you been gone so long
I forgot what you feel like
But I'm not gonna think about that right now
I'm gonna keep getting underneath you
I'm gonna keep getting underneath you
And all our friends want us to fall in love

[Chorus]
If you wanna start a fight
You better throw the first punch
Make it a good one
And if ya wanna make it through the night
You better say my name like

[Verse 1]
If you're a lover, you should know
The lonely moments just get lonelier
The longer you're in love
Than if you were alone
Memories turn into daydreams
Become a taboo
I don't want to be afraid
The deeper that I go
It takes my breath away
Soft hearts electric souls
Heart to heart and eyes to eyes
Is this taboo?

[Chorus]
Baby we built this house
On memories
Take my picture now
Shake it til you see it
And when your fantasies
Become your legacy
Promise me a place
In your house of memories

[Verse 2]
I think of you from time to time
More than I thought I would
You were just too kind
And I was too young to know
That's all that really matters
I was a fool

Baby we built this house
On memories
Take my picture now
Shake it til you see it
And when your fantasies
Become your legacy
Promise me a place
In your house of memories

Past lovers
They'll always haunt me
I wish I
Could believe
You'd never wrong me
Then will you
Remember
Me in the same way
As I remember you

Baby we built this house
On memories
Take my picture now
Shake it til you see it
And when your fantasies

There's no sunshine
This impossible year
Only black days and sky grey
And clouds full of fear
And storms full of sorrow
That won't disappear
Just typhoons and monsoons
This impossible year

There's no good times
This impossible year
Just a beachfront of bad blood
And a coast that's unclear
All the guests at the party
They're so insincere
They just intrude and exclude
This impossible year

There's no you and me
This impossible year
Only heartache and heartbreak
And gin made of tears
The bitter pill I swallow
The scars souvenir
That tattoo, your last bruise
This impossible year

There's never air to breathe
There's never in-betweens
These nightmares always hang on past the dream

There's no sunshine
There's no you and me
There's no good times

Hold the pose, fein perception
Grudges break your back

Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies

How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, rise!

Crucify and witness
Circling the sun
Bastardized in ruin
What have you become?
Blame the world and blame your maker
Wish 'em to the undertaker
Crown yourself the other savior

Hit the ground and Heaven crumbles

Swallow all your pride

When we’re seduced, then may it be
That we not deviate our cause

It’s all we’ve ever known
When flame consumes, may it be

When loss has won, may it be
It’s you I’m madly fighting for
When kingdom comes, may it be

All for publicity
Destruction going viral

Bulletproof
Ah, kill the truth
You’re falling, but you think you’re flying high
High again

Sold your soul
Built a higher wall
Yesterday
Now you’re thrown away

Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame

Twisted
Backstabbing wicked
The delusion absolution

In a limousine

It's such a freaky scene

I started a joke, which started the whole world crying
But I didn’t see that the joke was on me, oh no

I looked at the skies, running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed, hurting my head from things that I’d said

I started to cry, which started the whole world laughing

I looked at the skies, running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed, hurting my head from things that I’d said

Oh, if I’d only seen that the joke was on me"

[Intro]
Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh, I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

[Solo]

[Verse 2]
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo figaro magnifico
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Ah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh mamma mia, mamma mia) Mama mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me

[Verse 3]
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!

Baby I've been lookin' for a diamond
I could never touch it and it shines like ice
Everything is written in the sky and
Baby you can have it if you say it nice
Come on, baby, let's do somethin' ugly
Somethin' you would never touch yourself
Now let it bleed from me

Are you big? Are you ugly?
Can you kill a man with your hands?
Are you hot? Do you want me?
Think I don't understand?

Shotgun, grapeshot, tryptophobe
Baby I got somethin' you can stifle

Somethin' you would never touch yourself
Just let it bleed from me
I just wanna make you come out

They call me a menace
They say that I’m cursed
But somethin' about me is makin' 'em jealous
So listen and learn
I herd 'em like cattle
Cause I’m surrounded by cowards
And I don’t give a fuck when I walk into battle
And thats why I got all the power
I’m where you wanna be
Ain’t no one ahead of me
All of my enemies made a decision
It's better to follow me
I make no apologies
All of my sins I would repeat and I repeat
Cause I'ma be me 'til the death of me, oh yeah

[Chorus]
I can smell your fear
The only reason that I’m here
Is to wreak havoc
Everybody prayin' that I’ll change, yeah
Maybe one day but tomorrow I’ll be back at it
Cause bad habits they die hard
We live fast we die hard
Go against me you’ll die hard
Die hard

[Verse 2]
I dine with the blood on my hands
Thrive when I’m beatin' the man
All I learned in the pen
Is never get caught
Just get out and hit it again
Straight outta context
Ain't see me come like it's phone sex
Ain't hear me tick like a Rolex
Cause I’m keepin' a nuclear conscience
I fly like an atom bomb
In a world riddled with conflict
Hate that you need me
Wanna destroy me but you can’t
You're gonna deploy me in the end
Better believe that I'ma be me 'til the death of me, oh yeah

[Chorus]
I can smell your fear
The only reason that I’m here
Is to wreak havoc
Everybody prayin' that I’ll change, yeah
Maybe one day but tomorrow I’ll be back at it
Cause bad habits they die hard
We live fast we die hard
Go against me you’ll die hard
Die hard

[Bridge]
And if love is real
Maybe I’m just too bad
To remember how good it feels
My heart is still

[Chorus]
I can smell your fear
The only reason that I’m here
Is to wreak havoc
Everybody prayin' that I’ll change, yeah
Maybe one day but tomorrow I’ll be back at it

We live fast we die hard
Go against me you’ll die hard

Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I've created a monster, ‘cause nobody wants ta
See Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (heyyy!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
‘Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that! Cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, ‘cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits; fuck you, Debbie!

[Hook: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me!
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me

‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch!!!""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass {​​smack}​​
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass; you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, attention please
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?

A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat with
Anybody who's talking ""this shit, that shit""
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You 36-year-old baldheaded fag, blow me!
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
No, I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy
(Heyyy!) There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty without me

[Hook: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me!
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me

I get bored of basic bitches
She's the baddest, straight up vicious, texting her and asking her
If she's alone and if she'd sent some pictures, she said no (what)
Well goddamn, she said come over and see it for yourself
Never asking for your help, independent woman
She ain't for the shelf
No, she's the one
Smoke with her till the weed is gone
Stayin' up until we see the sun
Baddest ever, I swear she do it better than I've ever seen it done
Never borrow, she ain't ever loan
That's when she told me she ain't never ever ever ever gonna be owned

[Verse 5: Grace]
I don't tell you what to say
I don't tell you what to do
So just let me be myself

I'm free and I love to be free
To live my life the way I want
To say and do whatever I please

I wonder if he let me fly it, but it's a long shot

But fuck that laid top out on the boat
Heard you fucked around at Philippine and 1 OAK
My man seen you both at the Sonoko
Kissing and touching, lied and said that this was your cousin
Shit, I should have known when you stole money
Bitch called the cop and rolled on me
So good, I got old money
To lay on any motherfucking beach on the planet
With equestrian colored salmon
We examine my life and make sure I'm never dumb again
But first, slide your panties to the side girl, I'm comin' in

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
I torture you, take my hand through the flames
I torture you, I'm a slave to your games
(Iâ€˜m just a sucker for pain)
I wanna chain you up
I wanna tie you down
I'm just a sucker for pain

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
I'm a sucker for pain
I got the squad tatted on me from my neck to my ankles
Pressure from the man got us all in rebellion
We gon' go to war, yeah, without failure
Do it for the fam dog, ten toes down dog
Love and the loyalty that's what we stand for
Alienated by society
All this pressure give me anxiety
Walk slow through the fire
Like, who gon' try us?
Feeling the world go against us
So we put the world on our shoulders

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
I torture you, take my hand through the flames
I torture you, I'm a slave to your games
(I'm just a sucker for pain)
I wanna chain you up
I wanna tie you down
I'm just a sucker for pain

[Verse 2: Logic]
I been at it with my homies
It don't matter, you don't know me
I been rollin' with my team, we the illest on the scene
I been riding 'round the city with my squad
I been riding 'round the city with my squad
We just posted, getting crazy, living like this is so amazing
Hold up take a step back, when we roll up, cause I know what
We been loyal, we been fam, we the ones you trust in
Won't hesitate to go straight to your head like a concussion
I know I been bussin', no discussion for my family
No hesitation, through my scope I see my enemy
Like what's up? Hold up, we finna re-load up
Yes I re-load up, I know what up, I know what up

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
I torture you, take my hand through the flames
I torture you, I'm a slave to your games

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uh, devoted to destruction
A full dosage of detrimental dysfunction
I'm dying slow but the devil tryna rush me
See I'm a fool for pain, I'm a dummy
Might cut my head off right after I slit my throat
Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat
Eating peanut butter and jelly fishes on toast
And if I get stung I get stoked, might choke
Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal, naked in the North Pole
That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul
And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads
So I don't fear shit but tomorrow
And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nuttin' but pain
You just fuckin' complain, you ain't tough as you claim
Just stay up in your lane, just don't fuck with Lil Wayne
I'ma jump from my plane or stand in front of a train
Cause I'm a sucker for pain

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Used to doing bad, now we feel like we just now getting it
Ain't got no other way so we start it and finish it
No pain, no gain
Never stand down, made our own way
Never going slow, we pick up the pace
This is what we wanted from a young age
No emotion, that's what business is
Lord have mercy on the witnesses

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
I torture you, take my hand through the flames
I torture you, I'm just a sucker for pain

[Outro: Sam Harris]
More pain
Got me begging, begging, begging, begging, begging
For more pain
Got me begging, begging, begging, begging, begging
For more pain
Got me begging, begging, begging, begging, begging
For more pain"

Rock,Twenty One Pilots,Vessel ,Holding on to You (live at LC Pavillion) ,"I'm taking over my body, back in control, no more shotty,
I bet a lot of me was lost, 't's uncrossed and 'i's undotted,
I fought it a lot and it seems a lot like flesh is all I got,
Not anymore, flesh out the door, swat,
I must've forgot, you can't trust me,
I'm open a moment and close when you show it,
Before you know it I'm lost at sea,
And now that I write and think about it,
And the story unfolds,
You should take my life, you should take my soul.

You are surrounding all my surroundings,
Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain,
You are surrounding all my surroundings,
Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes.

And I'll be holding on to you.

And I'll be holding on to you.

Remember the moment you know exactly where you're going,
'Cause the next moment, before you know it,
Time is slowing and it's frozen still,
And the window sill looks really nice, right?
You think twice about your life, it probably happens at night,
right? Fight it, take the pain, ignite it,
Tie a noose around your mind loose enough to breathe fine and tie it,
To a tree, tell it, ""You belong to me,
This ain't a noose, this is a leash,
And I have some news for you, you must obey me.""

Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain,

Rock,Twenty One Pilots,Vessel ,Migraine ,"Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat
Shadows will scream that I'm alone

I-I-I've got a migraine
and my pain will range from up down and sideways
thank God it's Friday
cause Fridays will always be better than Sundays
cause Sunday's are my suicide days
I don't know why they always seem so dismal
Thunderstorms, cloud, snow, and a slight drizzle
Whether it's the weather or the letters by my bed
sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head
Let it be said what the headache represents
It's me defending in suspense
It's me suspended in a defenseless

test being tested by a ruthless examiner

that's represented best by my depress... ing thoughts
I do not have writers block

my writer just hates the clock
it will not let me sleep, I'll get some sleep when I'm dead

and sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head
Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat
Shadows will scream that I'm alone
But I know we've made it this far, kid
yeah, yeah, yeah
I am not as fine as I seem pardon
Me for yelling I'm telling you green gardens
are not what's growing in my psyche
it's a different me
a difficult to be, stop feasting lumber down trees
freeze frame
please let me paint a mental picture portrait

something you won't forget, it's all about my forehead
deny what is important, holds back contents
that make pandora's box contents' look non-violent

Behind my eyelids are islands of violence
my mind shipwrecked, this is the only land my mind could find
I did not know it was such a violent island
Full of tidal waves, suicidal crazed lions

They're trying to eat me blood running down their chin
and they know that I can fight or I can let the lion win
I begin to assemble what weapons I can find
Cause sometimes to stay alive you gotta kill your mind

Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat
Shadows will scream that I'm alone
But I know we've made it this far, kid
yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah
And I will say that we should take a day to break away
from all the pain our brain has made

the game is not played alone
And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it
and keep it frozen and know that life has a hopeful undertone
And I will say that we should take a day to break away
from all the pain our brain has made
the game is not played alone
And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it

Rock,Twenty One Pilots,Vessel ,Car Radio ,"I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire
Exhale desire
I know it's dire
My time today

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
Cause somebody stole
My car radio

And now I just sit in silence

Sometimes quiet is violent
I find it hard to hide it
My pride is no longer inside
It's on my sleeve
My skin will scream
Reminding me of
Who I killed inside my dream
I hate this car that I'm driving
There's no hiding for me
I'm forced to deal with what I feel

There is no distraction to mask what is real
I could pull the steering wheel

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought

Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence

I ponder of something terrifying
Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And it's that we're all battling fear
Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
Oh my, too deep - please stop thinking
I liked it better when my car had sound
There are things we can do
But from the things that work there are only two
And from the two that we choose to do
Peace will win
And fear will lose
There's faith and there's sleep
We need to pick one please because
Faith is to be awake
And to be awake is for us to think

And for us to think is to be alive
And I will try with every rhyme
To come across like I am dying
To let you know you need to try to think

I have these thoughts
So often I ought

To replace that slot
With what I once bought
Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence

I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire
Exhale desire
I know it's dire
My time today

So often I ought

With what I once bought

Rock,Twenty One Pilots,Vessel ,Fake You Out ,"I want to drive away
In the night, headlights call my name

I, I'll never be, be what you see inside
You say I'm not alone, but I am petrified
You say that you are close, is close the closest star?
You just feel twice as far, you just feel twice as far

And I'll fall
And I'll break
And I'll fake
All I wanna

And I'll fall down
And I'll break down
And I'll fake you out
All I wanna

I'm so afraid

All I wanna
And I'll fall down
And I'll break down

And I'll fake you out
All I wanna
It's the same game today as it always is
I don't give these places fake my name explaining this
And the wrists of my mind have the bleeding lines
That remind me of all the times...
I have committed
Dirty dirty crimes that are perfectly form-fitted
To what I've done and what I'm doing
I'm brewing and losing and spewing infusing
And believe me that's what all the kids are doing
What kids are doing are killing themselves
They feel they have no control of their prisoner's cell
And if you're one of them then you're one of me
And you would do almost anything just to feel free...
Am I right? Of course I am
Convince me otherwise would take all night

Before you walk away, there's one more thing I want to say
Our brains are sick but that's okay
And I'll fall

And I'll break
And I'll fake
All I wanna
All I wanna
Yeah, and I'll fall down
And I'll break down
And I'll fake you out
All I wanna

I scream, you scream
We all scream 'cause we're terrified
Of what's around the corner
We stay in place
‘Cause we don't want to lose our lives

So let's think of something better.
Down in the forest we'll sing a
One that everybody knows
Hands held higher, we'll be on fire
Singing songs that nobody wrote.

White flags are hoisted
I took some food for thought
It might be poisoned

Singing songs that nobody wrote
Quickly moving towards a storm
Moving forward, torn
In to pieces over reasons
Of what these storms are for
I don't understand why everything I adore
Takes a different form when I squint my eyes
Have you ever done that
When you squint your eyes
And your eyelashes make it look a little not right
And then when just enough light

Comes from just the right side
And you find you're not who you're suppose to be?
This is not what you're suppose to see
Please, remember me? I am suppose to be
King of a kingdom or swinging on a swing
Something happened to my imagination
This situation's becoming dire
My treehouse is on fire
And for some reason I smell gas on my hands

This is not what I had planned
This is not what I had planned.

Flies and cobwebs unwind
They will not take you down
They will not cast you out.

Dear friend, here we are again pretending
To understand how you think your world is ending
Sending signals and red flags in waves
It's hard to tell the difference between blood and water these days
I'll pray that one day you see
The only difference between life and dying
Is one is trying, that's all we're called to do
So try to love me and I'll try to save you.

Won't you stay alive
I'll take you on a ride
I will make you believe you are lovely.

Won't you stay alive

Nobody dreams when they blink
Think things on the brink of blasphemy
I'm my own shrink
Think things are after me, my catastrophe
At my kitchen sink, you don't know what that means
Because a kitchen sink to you
Is not a kitchen sink to me, ok friend?
Are you searching for purpose?
Then write something, yeah it might be worthless
Then paint something then, it might be wordless
Pointless curses, nonsense verses
You'll see purpose start to surface
No one else is dealing with your demons
Meaning maybe defeating them
Could be the beginning of your meaning, friend

Go away
Go away
Go away
Go away
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone

Nobody thinks what you think, no one
Empathy might be on the brink of extinction
They will play a game and say
They know what you're going through
And I tried to come up with an artistic way to say
They don't know you, and neither do I
So here's a prime example of a stand up guy
Who hates what he believes and loves it at the same time
Here's my brother and his head's screwed up
But that's alright.

Time gains momentum the moment when I'm living in 'em
I'm winning a momentary sinning a moment passing after
A re-beginning moments mending memories
Pretending enemies are friend of me, sending me straight to bending me
My bad behavior but I bet I could have been a better man
Copy and paste caught me, and copy, better rhymes bother me
The better the rhythm the badder I am but I bet I'll battle with 'em battle
better I am, Gambling man, better bet I am a gambling man, I am?

Go away
Go away
Go away
Go away
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Don't leave me alone

Fall off the grid.

But do I want to say goodbye to all the glowing eyes

cobwebs and flies come out
I hear a second voice behind your tongue somehow.
Luckily I can read your mind
flies and cobwebs unwind
they will not take you down
they will not cast you out.

Dear friend, here we are again pretending
to understand how you think your world is ending
sending signals and red flags in waves
it's hard to tell the difference between blood and water these days.
I'll pray that one day you see
the only difference between life and dying
Is one is trying, that's all we're called to do
so try to love me and I'll try to save you.

Won't you stay alive
I'll take you on a ride
I will make you believe you are lovely.

Won't you stay alive

I'm coming clean.

Tie a noose around your mind loose enough to breathe fine and tie it,
To a tree, tell it, ""You belong to me,

Rock,Twenty One Pilots,Vessel ,Ode To Sleep ,"I wake up fine and dandy but then by the time I find it handy
To rip my heart apart and start planning my crash landing
I go up, up, up, up, up to the ceiling
Then I feel my soul start leaving, like an old man's hair receding
I'm pleading please, oh please on my knees repeatedly asking
Why it's got to be like this, is this living free
I don't want to be the one, be the one who has the sun's blood on my hands
I'll tell the moon, take this weapon forged in darkness
Some see a pen, I see a harpoon.

I'll stay awake
'Cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight.

Why am I not scared in the morning
I don't hear those voices calling
I must have kicked them out, I must have kicked them out
I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone, they told me I was gone.

But I'll tell them
Why won't you let me go?
Do I threaten all your plans?
I'm insignificant.
Please tell them you have no plans for me.
I will set my soul on fire, what have I become?
I'll tell them.

On the eve of a day that's forgotten and fake
And the trees they await and clouds anticipate
The start of a day when we put on our face
A mask that portrays that we don't need grace
On the eve of a day that is bigger than us
But we open our eyes 'cause we're told that we must
And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead
Desperately yelling there's something we need
I'm not free, I asked forgiveness three times
Same amount that I denied, I three-time mvp'ed this crime
I'm afraid to tell you who I adore, won't tell you who I'm singing towards
Metaphorically I'm a whore, and that's denial number four.

I'll stay awake
'Cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight.

Why am I not scared in the morning
I don't hear those voices calling
I must have kicked them out, I must have kicked them out

Cause somebody stole

Sometimes quiet is violent
I find it hard to hide it
My pride is no longer inside
It's on my sleeve
My skin will scream
Reminding me of
Who I killed inside my dream

There's no hiding for me

There is no distraction to mask what is real

I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And it's that we're all battling fear
Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
Oh my, too deep - please stop thinking

But from the things that work there are only two
And from the two that we choose to do

And fear will lose

And your eyelashes make it look a little not right
And then when just enough light
Comes from just the right side
And you find you're not who you're suppose to be?
This is not what you're suppose to see
Please, remember me? I am suppose to be

When we gunna stop with it,
Lyrics that mean nothing, we were gifted with thought,
Is it time to move our feet to anspective beat,
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts, it's our hearts that make the beat.

(And I'll be holding on to you) And I'll be holding on to you.
(And I'll be holding on to you) And I'll be holding on to you.
(And I'll be holding on to you) And I'll be holding on to you.
(And I'll be holding on to you) And I'll be holding on to you!"
Rock,Twenty One Pilots,Vessel ,Car Radio (Live at the Newport) ,"I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire
Exhale desire
I know it's dire
My time today

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence

Sometimes quiet is violent
I find it hard to hide it
My pride is no longer inside
It's on my sleeve
My skin will scream
Reminding me of
Who I killed inside my dream
I hate this car that I'm driving
There's no hiding for me
I'm forced to deal with what I feel
There is no distraction to mask what is real
I could pull the steering wheel

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence

I ponder of something terrifying
'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And it's that we're all battling fear
Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
Oh my,
Too deep
Please stop thinking
I liked it better when my car had sound

There are things we can do
But from the things that work there are only two
And from the two that we choose to do
Peace will win
And fear will lose
There's faith and there's sleep
We need to pick on please because
Faith is to be awake
And to be awake is for us to think
And for us to think is to be alive a
And I will try with every rhyme
To come across like I am dying
To let you know you need to try to think

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence

I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire
Exhale desire
I know it's dire
My time today

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence"
Rock,Twenty One Pilots,Vessel ,Guns For Hands (Dzeko & Torres Remix) ,"I know what you think in the morning,
When the sun shines on the ground,
And shows what you have done,
It shows where your mind has gone,
And you swear to your parents,
That it will never happen again,
I know, I know what that means, I know.
That you all have guns,
And you never put the safety on,
And you all have plans,
To take it, don't take it.

I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep,
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep,
But I can't, but I can't when you all have,
Guns for hands.

Let's take this a second at a time,
Let's take this one song, this one rhyme,
Together, let's breathe,
Together, to the beat,
But there's hope out the window,
So that's where we'll go,
Let's go outside and all join hands,
But until then you'll never understand.
That you all have guns,
And you never put the safety on,
And you all have plans,
To take it, don't take it.

We've turned our hands to guns, trade in our thumbs for ammunition,
I must forewarn you, of my disorder, or my condition,
'Cause when the sun sets, it upsets what's left of my invested interest,
Interested in putting my fingers to my head,
The solution is, I see a whole room of these mutant kids,
Fused at the wrist, I simply tell them they should shoot at this,
Simply suggest my chest and this confused music, it's,
Obviously best for them to turn their guns to a fist."
Rock,Twenty One Pilots,Vessel ,Semi-Automatic ,"Night falls, with gravity.
The earth turns, from sanity
Taking my only friend I know
He leaves a lot, his name is Hope.

I'm never what I like
I'm double-sided.
And I just can't hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry
Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside.

The horrors of the night melt away
Under the warm glow of survival of the day
Then we move on
My shadow grows taller along with my fears
And my frame shrinks smaller as night grows near

When the sun is coming, windowsills
And the silver lining rides the hills
I will be saved for one whole day
Until the sun make the hills its grave

I'm never what I like
I'm double-sided.
And I just can't hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry
Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside.

I'm never what I like
I'm double-sided.
And I just can't hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry
Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside my mind.

I'm semi-automatic
My prayers schizophrenic
But I'll live on, yeah I'll live on, yeah I'll live on
By the time the night wears off, the dust is down

And shadows burn
I will rise and stand my ground
Waiting for the night's return.
I'm never what I like

I'm double-sided.
And I just can't hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry
Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside.

Am I painting the picture that's in my brain
A train from the sky locomotive my motives are insane
My flows not great
Okay
I conversate with people who know if I flow
When my song got no radio play
While you're doing fine
There's some people and I
Who have a really tough time

Getting through this life

Rock,Twenty One Pilots,Vessel ,Holding On To You - Live at The Newport Music Hall ,"I'm taking over my body, back in control, no more shotty
I bet a lot of me was lost, 't's uncrossed and 'i's undotted
I fought it a lot and it seems a lot like flesh is all I got
Not anymore, flesh out the door, swat
I must've forgot, you can't trust me
I'm open a moment and close when you show it
Before you know it I'm lost at sea
And now that I write and think about it
And the story unfolds
You should take my life, you should take my soul.

You are surrounding all my surroundings
Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain
You are surrounding all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes.

(ahh, ahh) And I'll be holding on to you

(ahh, ahh) And I'll be holding on to you

Remember the moment you know exactly where you're going
'Cause the next moment, before you know it
Time is slowing and it's frozen still
And the window sill looks really nice, right?
You think twice about your life, it probably happens at night
right? Fight it, take the pain, ignite it
Tie a noose around your mind loose enough to breathe fine and tie it
To a tree, tell it, ""You belong to me
This ain't a noose, this is a leash
And I have news for you, you must obey me.""

You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain
You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes.

Entertain my faith (repeat x10)

Lean with it, rock with it

When we gonna stop with it?

Lyrics that mean nothing

We were gifted with thought

Is it time to move our feet

To an introspective beat

It ain't the speakers that bump hearts

It's our hearts that make the beat

Lean with it, rock with it

When we gonna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothing
We were gifted with, thought
Is it time to move our feet

It ain't the speakers that bump hearts
It's our hearts that make the beat
Lean with it rock with it

Did you lose your way?
In this tug of war, you’re a lightweight
I’ll be sitting tight, so do whatever you like to do

You’ve got to do something reckless

Got me in a fix
While you’re playing with your girl, you do
You’re up to your tricks
So you call me when she’s out of view

If she’s everything that you’re looking for
Why ya calling me? ‘Cause I give you more
Go make up your mind
'Cause I’m not waiting in line for you

You know I know you’ve been restless,
I know you know you could get this
You’ve got to do something reckless
Come on baby won’t you talk to me?

I know you know we know there’s something to be said
Inching past the daydreams, inching towards your bed
I hope you know I’ll go away if you don’t try
It’s time to open up and let me come inside

But I like your sweater
Like how you wear it loose

You got me on the moon

Floating on your rhythm
I think it’s almost 3
Now I smoked up all the weed
So you’re all that I can see

Boy your moves are poppin'
And everybody knows
That when you start hoppin’
The living room explodes

Now the room is swimming
But you don’t really care
Ran your fingers through my hair
Now we’re skipping down the stairs

So you play it wild

I’m so glad you came
Got me all beguiled
You don’t know the game
So you play it wild

Baby tell me how you do it, puffing up your feathers
Unexpected swagger, you could swing me ‘round forever
I don’t wanna say that I’ll be thinking 'bout you always
But I like the freaky dance we’re doing in the hallway

Tell me what’s your name

'Bout the way she said your name
How you couldn't live without her

Scratching at each other's scars
Tell me how would that be better?
Wouldn't get us very far

Running your mouth about the way that I’ve been living
Girl you just keep on digging
This gift just keeps on giving, if you're

Trying to cut me down, you better reconsider
You know my skin is thicker, so just
ease up off the trigger

You’ve been talking for so long
can’t you just leave me alone?

Stop - I don’t wanna hear it
You been talking too long
Stop - I don’t wanna hear it
You been singing that same sad song

Stop - you don’t wanna hear it
Always thinking you’re strong
Stop - girl you gotta hear it
You been singing that same sad song

Not sure how you think we’re having fun,
party’s all done and you’ve just begun.
Tryna clean up but you took the floor,
wanna sweep your mess right out the door.

Looking you up and down you’re close to boiling over
You’re losing your composure,

faded from overexposure, and you're

Reaching - you’re always making simple things a struggle
You know you’re making trouble
You’re anything but subtle

Rock,Marian Hill,Act One ,Mistaken ," featuring Steve Davit


I been tryna wipe you outta my mind
Begging you to call me some other time
Looking in the rearview
hoping that I leave you behind

Thinking bout the things I know I should do
Thinking bout how I don’t ever need you
Thinking bout you daily
Thinking maybe you should come through

I been tryna shake it
But I know
There ain’t no mistakin’

Thought I could deny this craving,
caught me gazing, now I’m caving in
Thought that I could break it,
but I think you know
There ain’t no mistakin’

I been tryna kick you outta my head
Loving all the extra space in my bed
Falling into daydreams
Then I think about what you said


""Girl you got that high-life, double-time swing
and I’m like a low-key, summertime drink
Don’t know how to fight it
Tell me baby what do you think?”

I been tryna shake it
But I know
There ain’t no mistakin’

Thought I could deny this craving,
caught me gazing, now I’m caving in
Thought that I could break it
But I think you know
there ain’t no mistakin’

Tried so hard to get free,
breaking with the current, put
up my guard, couldn’t see
We were right in front of me

I can’t sleep, can’t you see?
Baby what you do to me
Tried so hard
Now I see

I been tryna shake it
But I know
There ain’t no mistakin’

Thought I could deny this craving,
caught me gazing, now I’m caving in
Thought that I could break it
But I think you know
there ain’t no mistakin’"
Rock,Marian Hill,Act One ,Same Thing ,"Call me up and
I'll come over
every single time

In your driveway
Still alone, I'm
trying to rewind

In your bedroom
In the dark, we
play with old mistakes

After midnight
You're asleep but
I stay wide awake

Take my hand, let it go
Make it stop, hold me close
But it's still the same old thing

Pick me up, put me down
Walk away, turn around
But it's still the same old thing

Toss and turn, then relax
Running from, running back
But it's still the same old thing

In your arms, yet again
Never want it to end
But it’s still the same
thing.

Call you up and
you come over
Every single time

See your headlights
Feel my heart rate
slowly start to climb

In my doorway
We don’t talk, there’s
nothing left to say

Grab your hair and
pull you close but
I am miles away

Take my hand, let it go
Make it stop, hold me close
But it's still the same old thing

Pick me up, put me down
Walk away, turn around
But it's still the same old thing

Toss and turn, then relax
Running from, running back
But it's still the same old thing

In your arms, yet again
Never want it to end
But it’s still the same
thing.

Wish I knew the start to end
Say I do but I pretend
Here by night and gone by day
I always think but never say"
Rock,Marian Hill,Act One ,I Want You ,"[VERSE 1]
Well babe I've got this drink
Turns out I've got some space
I love to drink alone
I hate this empty place
I'd like to spend some time
You look like Friday night
I'd like to dress you up and
Take you on a carpet ride

I've seen a couple things
I know the way it goes
Like everybody says
Cause everybody knows
Maybe you're the one for me
We could be so cliche
I hate to see you leave but
Love to watch you walk away

I've been so tired on the weekend
I've been holding on too tight
I never thought I'd be thinking
""I want-""
I spent the whole summer sleeping
You've been staying up all night
I never thought I'd be thinking
""I want you""

[VERSE 2]
Don't make me play this game
Don't have the time to waste
Don't need to read my mind
Cause I'll just tell you straight
Why don't you show me 'round?
And I can show you off
And if we're not too careful
Baby we can both get lost

Rock,Queen,Greatest Hits ,Bohemian Rhapsody ,"Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality

Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy
I need no sympathy

Because I'm easy come, easy go
Little high, little low
Any way the wind blows
Doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away

Mama, ooh
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time

Goodbye everybody
I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind
And face the truth

Mama, ooh
(Any way the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very very frightening me
(Galileo, Galileo, Galileo, Galileo, Galileo, Figaro)
Magnifico

I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity

Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go!

Will not let you go!

No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh mama mia, mama mia
Mama mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside
For me, for me, for me

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here

Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me

It started out so perfect, something god could only create.
I yearned enough for thinking you on this special day.???
Never once did i take for granted that you've been hurt before.
So you treated me like a lady and even more.
So i can't understand why you brought storms into my life.
Tell me why, you destroyed every part of me.
Now what once a beautiful lady that you showered with your love must live with
A heart that bleeds.
This way again. that was the end. so please don't take offense when i say
What i have to say.
Cause if you died i wouldn't cry cause you never loved me any way.

Promises made and secrets told
Laying nights bent in ecstasy, we made love in a bed of roses for the universe
To see. there was no holding back from each other, both of our minds were
Free. we never wasted time apart, boy it seems like entirety.
So i can't understand why you brought this pain into my life. oh tell me why.
I gave you a reason to live and you used my love in vain . so go on by
Yourself to survive this alone. you know you can't come back home.
I hope you never come this way again. you did, you did. so please don't take
Offense when i say what i have to say.

Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed
  and torn
Why - why - why
Love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're
  cracking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more 
  chance
Why can't we give love
Cause love's such an old fashioned word
and love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves
Under pressure

Somebody To Love (Mercury)
Can anybody find me somebody to love?
Each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord what you're doing to me
I have spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord!
Somebody, somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

I work hard every day of my life
I work till I ache my bones
At the end I take home my hard earned pay all on my own -
I get down on my knees
And I start to pray
Till the tears run down from my eyes
Lord - somebody - somebody
Can anybody find me - somebody to love?

(He works hard)

Everyday - I try and I try and I try -
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm goin' crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
Got no common sense
I got nobody left to believe
Yeah - yeah yeah yeah

Oh Lord
Somebody - somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

Got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat
I'm ok, I'm alright
Ain't gonna face no defeat
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
Someday I'm gonna be free, Lord!

Find me somebody to love
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

Fear me, you lords and lady preachers,
I descend upon your earth from the skies;
I command your very souls, you unbelievers,
Bring before me what is mine, the seven seas of Rhye

Can you hear me, you peers and privy councillors,
I stand before you naked to the eyes;
I will destroy any man who dares abuse my trust
I swear that you'll be mine, at the seven seas of Rhye

Sister, I live and lie for you, Mister, do and I'll die;
You are mine, I posess you, belong to you forever  Ah

Storm the master marathon I'll fly through by flash and thunder fire
and I'll survive, I'll survive, I'll survive, then I'll defy
the laws of nature and come out alive
Begone with you, you shod and shady senators
Give out the good leave out the bad evil cries;
I challenge the mighty titan and his troubadours,
And with a smile, I'll take you to the seven seas of Rhye"

It started off so well
They said we made a perfect pair
I clothed myself in your glory and your love
How I loved you,

The years of care and loyalty
Were nothing but a sham it seems
The years belie we lived a lie
""I'll love you 'til I die""

Save me Save me Save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me Save me Oh...
I'm naked and I'm far from home

The slate will soon be clean
I'll erase the memories,
To start again with somebody new
Was it all wasted
All that love?.....
I hang my head and I advertise
A soul for sale or rent
I have no heart, I'm cold inside
I have no real intent

Save me Save me Save me

Oh it hurts so bad.
It started out so perfect, something god could only create.
I yearned enough for thinking you on this special day.???
Never once did i take for granted that you’ve been hurt before.
So you treated me like a lady and even more.
So i can’t understand why you brought storms into my life.
Tell me why, you destroyed every part of me.
Now what once a beautiful lady that you showered with your love must live with
A heart that bleeds.
This way again. that was the end. so please don’t take offense when i say
What i have to say.
Cause if you died i wouldn’t cry cause you never loved me any way.

Promises made and secrets told
Laying nights bent in ecstasy, we made love in a bed of roses for the universe
To see. there was no holding back from each other, both of our minds were
Free. we never wasted time apart, boy it seems like entirety.
So i can’t understand why you brought this pain into my life. oh tell me why.
I gave you a reason to live and you used my love in vain . so go on by
Yourself to survive this alone. you know you can’t come back home.
I hope you never come this way again. you did, you did. so please don’t take
Offense when i say what i have to say.
If you died i wouldn’t cry cause you never . no way.
No way no way
How could this be
After all the love you said we shared you turned around and leave.
Boy you know you were my heart and soul but i can’t be bad?? i gotta let
You go.
Together forever that’s what we both said. i didn’t know that life could be
So unfair.
Baby you did this to me.
You were my lover
So please don’t take offense when i say what i have to say.
I hope you die, i hope you die
Cause you never loved me anyway.
I... you never never never never never never never never
You use to be my best friend. you can get struck by lighting, washed away by
The sea, burned in a fire just don’t bring it back to me. cause
Cause you never loved me anyway."

I had a sweet talking wife and a beautiful girl
I know I'm never gonna see 'em again
Gonna tear the world up till I have my revenge
They took my life but it isn't the end, Oh
They put me in the ground but I'm back from the dead

Whoo!
Ba bu duh

Ba ba ba baby

Oh I'm a world ender baby and I'm coming for them oh
They put me in the ground but I'm back from the dead

They hear me howl by the light of the moon
That's how you know that I'm coming for you
Gonna find you alone in the dark of night
But when the world ender comes better run for your life
I never bleed and I won't ever age
I'll never feel the embrace of the grave
But the fair and the brave and the good must die
I've seen the other side of living
I know heavens a lie
I tear through the night and I raise up hell
Cause I'm a world ender baby and I'm back from the dead

Lord knows I should be pushing daisies
I was six feet down only something raised me up
Sent back, 'fore I lift my curse
I'm gonna get me a taste of some chaos first
Don't tire, gonna get a lil' wild
Screamin' through the night like a demon child
Close your eyes now the light is fading
And the noise in the night is gonna get a little louder, baby

Hey!
Ba bu du
Ba ba baby

Oh I'm a world ender baby and I'm back from the grave
Oh they can run for their lives but they can not escape
I'm a world ender baby and I'm coming for them oh
They put me in the ground but I'm back from the dead"
Rock,Lord Huron,Strange Trails ,Fool for Love ,"I'm leaving this place behind
And i'm heading out on the road tonight
I'm off for the winter lands
Where i'm known to have taught you to stand
Before I commence my ride I'm asking Lily to be my bride
I know there's another man but he aint gonna delay my plans
I know she's gonna be my wife
Gonna fall in love I'm gonna live my life with her
You know I bet he's not so tough
Aint afraid of him cause I'm a fool for love

I've come far to find Big Jim
Well here I am and I guess you him
I see how you got your name you're tall as hell and braod as a train
They say you a hard-broiled man
And the baddest guy in the whole wide land
Well I'm not fraid to fight lets step outside and I'll show you why
I'm humming like a revved up truck nevermind the odds I'm gonna try my luck with her
Just tell me when you've had enough I'm dangerous cause I'm a fool for love
You know you don't hit half bad
For my love I will lay in the grave tonight
Just wait until I catch my breathe
Gonna send you off and annihilate

I lie in the drifting snow bleeding out it's as cold as we know
If spring comes before I'm found
Just throw my bones in a hole in the ground
I lost friend along my way
I knew I'd need them eventually
No I'm not afraid to die
Just mad I left Big Jim alive
I know I should've never looked back
But you aint gonna win a woman's heart like that
I never should've called his bluff
I was born to lose cause I'm a fool for love
I stare into the endless sky
And I saw a tale of my life go by
I drift into the great unknown I really don't know where I'm going
I stare into the endless sky
And I saw a tale of my life go by
I drift into the great unknown
No I really don't know where I'm going"

Who has not repaid his debt
I've been searching for a trail to follow again
Take me back to the night we met
and then, I can tell myself
What the hell I'm supposed to do
and then, I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you
I had all in the most of you
Something I'll never do
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Oh, take me back to the night we met
When the night was full of terror
and your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet
Oh, take me back to the night we met

with the moonlight as my guide
I will wander through the pines and make my way to nature's shrine

And I look up to the sky
and I know you're still alive
but I wonder where you are, I call your name into the dark

I wake up in the morning, oh, and I don't know where I've been
All alone on a mountainside and I'm huddled in the wind
And it feel like I've been away for an era but nothing has changed at all
And it feels like I've been with you, oh, but what did we do and where have you gone

On the night you disappeared
Oh if I had seen it clear
But a strange light in the sky was shining right into my eyes

There was no one else in sight
just the endless frozen pines
but I wonder all they know cuz they don't die and they don't grow

I am ready to follow you even though I don't know where
I will wait in the night until you decide to take me there
Cuz I know I don't stay here forever, it's time to be movin on
Oh I don't want to be the only one livin when all of my friends are gone

I will be waiting for you on the other side of the frozen pines
I'm gonna find a way through there's another light beyond the line
I will be waiting for you on the other side of the frozen pines
I'm gonna find a way through there's another life beyond the light"

While I was my cowbell
Tryina keep my eyes open wide
I'm going days without any rest
Saw a??? in the road looking back
About 20 years away
You come back from the city east
But you don't come back from the dead

Sure as hell he was dead as it comes
And he was already starting to smell
Just to keep his hair still back
And the knife turned in his bell
Was he unforgiving, just tryina live it about
Never felt like this
Though I was walking where he's at???

I've let him down in a grave in the sand
And he gripped my arm with his dead man's head
He said I know I'm dead but I don't wanna die
In a grave out here where the carrions cry
I step out into the endless void
And I ain't going back if I got any choice
I know how to leave, I know how to die
I believe in no thrills in the afterlife

So leave me up out here my friend
And I won't look back to your desire
Leave me wound here on through the sand
And he waved goodbye with his dead man's hand

And he'll all forever haunt in the desert
And he'll all forever haunt in the desert"

What if we're unmade when the stars fade?
Keep me going 'til the night turns into the day.

Telling me our time in the world is done,

Trying to keep my eyes open wide, I'd gone days without any rest.
Saw him lying in the road looking bad about 20 yards ahead.
You come back from a trip to the east but you don't come back from the dead.

Sure as hell he was dead as they come and he was already starting to smell.
Just a kid with his hair slicked back and a knife tucked into his belt.
Was he unforgiven or just tired of living a life that never felt like his?
Though I was was worn and weary, I thought I'd bury him
and lay his soul to rest out in the desert night.

I laid him down in a grave in the sand
and he grabbed my arm with his dead man's hand.
He said: ""I know I'm dead but I don't wanna lie
in a grave out here where the coyote's cry.

I stared right into the endless void
and I ain't going back if I got any choice.
I know how to live, I don't know how to die
and there ain't no thrills in the afterlife.

So lift me up out of here my friend

Up beyond the clouds, in ancient ground, so they say
And many men have died trekking up that away

The bravest men return with darkened hearts and phantom pain
Ages come and go but her life goes on the same
She lives to see the sun and feel the wind and drink the rain

Her colors change to mark the passing of the days
No Earthly sight can match the beauty she displays
And when I die I want her lying by my side
In my grave, in my grave

I'd give it all to love that girl
I'll be the one to pluck that fleur

I'm meant to find the place where all good things begin
To smell her scent and watch her dancing in the wind

and the sirens wail as we ran like hell down a strange trail
Oh, I wanna know what I did, I wanna know her game.
I wanna learn her wits and how she plays her tricks, oh, I gotta know.

Lots of booze and her kiss
These are drugs that do not mix.
I was under her spell
and today I feel like hell.
She got me going, I guess.
Who knew love would be like this?
Don't know what I'm gonna do
But I guess I gotta see it through.

Cause I don't know how to walk out of this deal.
The spell she cast on me is real.
I don't know how to right the wrongs I've done.
She bends the wills of men for fun.
I don't know how to take my own life back.
Everything she touches turns to black.
I don't know how to fight what I can't see.
That girl has laid a curse on me.

I gotta find me a cure.
I gotta clear my name.
There's gotta be some way
I hope it's not too late
To break the spell.

Yeah,
I want to get her alone.
I want to ask her why.
And look into those eyes
and see the endless night
staring back.

What kind of magic is this?
I was doomed by our first kiss.
Just a pawn in her game
I've done things that have no name.
And she'll make me do worse
If the law doesn't get me first
She has cloaked me in black
And there ain't no turning back.

There are runes on my skin.
They appear when she walks in.
I am bound by her spell.
I am chained to do her will.
I'm a goner, I guess.
Who knew love was gonna be like this?
She has cloaked me in black.
And there ain't no turning back.

Otherwise, get left behind

So try hard, then try and lean on God
Hold up, if this weren't true
Explain to me, what the cross is for

Christian,MercyMe,Lifer ,Even If ,"They say sometimes you win some
Sometimes you lose some
And right now, right now I'm losing bad
I've stood on this stage night after night
Reminding the broken it'll be alright
But right now, oh right now I just can't

It's easy to sing
When there's nothing to bring me down
But what will I say
When I'm held to the flame
Like I am right now

I know You're able and I know You can
Save through the fire with Your mighty hand
But even if You don't
My hope is You alone

They say it only takes a little faith
To move a mountain
Good thing
A little faith is all I have right now
But God, when You choose
To leave mountains unmovable
Give me the strength to be able to sing
It is well with my soul

I know You're able and I know You can
Save through the fire with Your mighty hand
But even if You don't
My hope is You alone
I know the sorrow, and I know the hurt
Would all go away if You'd just say the word
But even if You don't
My hope is You alone

You've been faithful, You've been good
All of my days
Jesus, I will cling to You
Come what may
‘Cause I know You're able
I know You can

I know You're able and I know You can
Save through the fire with Your mighty hand
But even if You don't
My hope is You alone
I know the sorrow, and I know the hurt
Would all go away if You'd just say the word
But even if You don't
My hope is You alone

It is well, it is well with my soul"
Christian,MercyMe,Lifer ,Hello Beautiful ,"No more
I quit
I've had enough
I wasn't made for this
To all the lies that have tried
To cripple me with doubt
I think it's time to say goodbye
I know who I am now
Part of me says I'd be
Smart to walk away
But before I leave, I think I need
To call you out by name

Goodbye regret
Goodbye alone
Goodbye to emptiness
Say hello to beautiful
Goodbye afraid
Goodbye ashamed
Goodbye to hopelessness
Say hello to beautiful

Can you hear it
That's the sound of me walking out
Of this prison cell
That I've come to know so well
I used to play the victim, singing
Take these chains from me
But they have long been broken
I was free and would not leave
Somehow I got too comfortable
Locked up here in this prison
That I missed the doors wide open
More like ripped off of its hinges

Goodbye regret
Goodbye alone
(Goodbye)
Goodbye to emptiness
Say hello to beautiful
(Beautiful)
Goodbye afraid
Goodbye ashamed
Goodbye to hopelessness
Say hello to beautiful

Hello, hello, hello beautiful
Hello, hello, hello beautiful
Hello, hello, hello beautiful
Hello, hello, hello beautiful

Before I go, just so you know
There will come days again
Wrestling not to believe
The things you say I am
When I've forgotten what's inside
And who I'm meant to be
I remember what's inside
Has not forgotten me

Goodbye regret
Goodbye alone
Goodbye to emptiness
Say hello to beautiful
Goodbye afraid
Goodbye ashamed
Goodbye to hopelessness
Say hello to beautiful
(To beautiful)

Hello, hello, hello beautiful
Hello, hello, hello beautiful

Your love is lifting me above all the lies
No matter what I face, this I know in time
You'll take all that is wrong and make it right
You'll take all that is wrong and make it right

Your strength is found at the end of my road
Your grace, it reaches to the hurting

Still through the tears and the questioning why,
I will stand my ground where hope can be found!

Christian,Lauren Daigle,How Can It Be ,Power to Redeem ,"(feat. All Sons & Daughters)

You take what is
And you make it beautiful
When love floods in,
We're resorted forever more

With breath that brings the dead to life,
With words that pierce the dark with light
Only by the blood are we set free.
With mercy strong to carry shame
and nail it to a tree You alone
hold the power to redeem.

No guilt competes
with innocence crucified.
No grave can hold what your grace has justified.
With breath that brings the dead to life,
With words that pierce the dark with light
Only by the blood are we set free.
With mercy strong to carry shame
and nail it to a tree You alone
hold the power to redeem.

Rejoice oh child of God
Lift your eyes to see
With every morning light,
Again we are redeemed
[x2]

With breath it brings the dead to life,
With words that pierce the dark with light
Only by the blood are we set free.
With mercy strong to carry shame
and nail it to a tree You alone
hold the power to redeem.

Oh you alone, hold the power to redeem [x3] "

Climb up on a horse and let it run full speed
Take a look down at the world from 30,000 feet
On your next flight

Watch a flock of birds against the morning sun
Close your eyes and listen to the river run
Catch a firefly in your hand or a raindrop on your tongue
That's right

There is a God
There is a God
There is a God
How much proof do you need?

Plant a seed and see what comes out of the ground
Find the heartbeat on your baby's ultrasound
In a few years hear it laughing
Don't it sound like a song?

Stop and think about what you don't understand
Things like life and love and how the world began
Hear the doctor say we can't explain it
But the cancer is gone

There is a God
There is a God
There is a God
How much more proof do you need?

Science says it's just all circumstance
Like this whole world's just an accident
But if you want to shoot that theory down
Look around
Just look around

There is a God

I have already come; 
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far 
And grace will lead me home.

We've no less days to sing God's praise 
Than when we've first begun

And He tells me I am His own;
And the joy we share as we tarry there,
None other has ever known.

Peace, peace, oh wonderful peace,
Coming down from the Father above!
Sweep over my spirit forever, I pray
In fathomless billows of love!

He speaks, and the sound of His voice
Is so sweet that the birds hush their singing,
And the melody that He gave to me
Within my heart is ringing.

And He walks with me, and He talks with me,
And He tells me I am His own;
And the joy we share as we tarry there,

Christian,Casting Crowns,The Very Next Thing ,One Step Away ,"What if you could go back and relive one day of your life all over again
And unmake the mistake that left you a million miles away
From the you, you once knew
Now yesterday's shame keeps saying that you'll never get back on track
But what if I told you…

You're one step away from surrender
One step away from coming home, coming home
One step from arms wide open
His love has never let you go
You're not alone
You're one step away

It doesn't matter how far you've gone
Mercy says you don't have to keep running down the road you're on
Love's never met a lost cause
Your shame, lay it down
Leave your ghosts in the past ‘cause you know that you can't go back
But you can turn around
You've never been more than…

One step away from surrender
One step away from coming home, coming home
One step from arms wide open
His love has never let you go
You're not alone (not alone)
You're one step away
One step away

Lay down, lay down your old chains
Come now, and take up your new name
Your best life up ahead now
You're one step away

So come on home, come on home
One step from arms wide open
His love has never let you go
You're not alone (you're not alone)
You're one step away

Lay down, lay down your old chains
Take up, take up your new name

Lay down, lay down your old chains
Come now, take up your new name
Your best life up ahead now
One step away

Lay down, lay down your old chains
Come now, and take up your new name

Why am I still holding back from You

So why am I still standing here

So afraid what it might cost to follow You
I'd walk by faith if I could get these feet to move
But I don't want to live that way
I don't want to look back someday
On a life that never stepped across the line

Why am I still holding back from You

But I'm still playing in the sand
Building little kingdoms that'll never stand
I hear You call me out into deeper waters
But I settle on the shallow end

I'm so tired of standing here
What if I gave everything to You

What if I gave everything
What if I stopped holding back from You
Starting now I'm stepping out onto deeper waters
What if I gave everything
What if I stopped holding back from You
Starting now I'm stepping out onto deeper waters
I want to see some mountains move

Ready to give everything
Say goodbye to standing here

Christian,Casting Crowns,The Very Next Thing ,God of All My Days ,"I came to You with my heart in pieces
And found the God with healing in His hands
I turned to You, put everything behind me
And found the God who makes all things new
I looked to You, drowning in my questions
And found the God who holds all wisdom
And I trusted You and stepped out on the ocean
You caught my hand among the waves
'Cause You're the God of all my days

Each step I take
You make a way
And I will give You all my praise
My seasons change, You stay the same
You're the God of all my days

I ran from You, I wandered in the shadows
And found a God who relentlessly pursues
I hid from You, haunted by my failure
And found the God whose grace still covers me
I fell on You when I was at my weakest
And found the God, the lifter of my head
And I've worshiped You
And felt You right beside me
You're the reason that I sing
'Cause You're the God of all my days

Each step I take
You make a way
And I will give You all my praise
My seasons change, You stay the same
You're the God of all my days

In my worry, God You are my stillness
In my searching, God You are my answers
In my blindness, God You are my vision
In my bondage, God You are my freedom
In my weakness, God You are my power
You're the reason that I sing
'Cause You're the God of all my days

Each step I take

Christian,Casting Crowns,The Very Next Thing ,When the God Man Passes By ,"When the God-man passes by
The blind will see and the dead will rise
Redeemed will dance and broken wings take flight
When the God-man passes by

I was a hollow man
My treachery despised and rightly so
And even though my chains were gone
I'm still a slave and reaping what I've sown
Call it desperation, I just had to see His face
So like a child, I climbed a sycamore tree
When the God-man called my name
I knew I'd never be the same

'Cause when the God-man passes by
The blind will see and the dead will rise
Redeemed will dance and broken wings take flight
When the God-man passes by

I was a runaway, a gypsy chasing shadows in the night
A prisoner of secrets till religion dragged my shame into the light
All my darkness was revealed, just when I thought my fate was sealed
My accusers dropped their stones and walked away
'Cause when the God-man cleansed my name
I knew I'd never be the same

You can come just as you are
Let Him have your broken heart
You have never run too far
There is freedom in His scars

When the God-man passes by

In the center of the storm You are my peace
You're the dreamer of my destiny
And all You have begun You will complete

No hope for being free

That saved a wretch like me

Was blind but now I see”

A sinner so far from home

That I'd spend the rest of my life

Telling my story of how mercy
Can reach You where You are
And I pray the whole world hears
The cry of my heart
Is to see all the ones I love
Loving my Jesus

Sin tries to make you hide
Whispers that same old lie
Keep all your pain inside
'Cause no one will understand
The last thing this lost world needs
Is someone I'm trying to be
Truth that has set me free
Is that I'm just a broken man

When all is said and done
When my last song's been sung
I stand face to face with the One
Who gave all for me
May all I have to show
Be all that mattered most

Between high stakes and pump fakes

It was just another summer night
Had to be the last thing on my mind
Yeah, I was all but lost in the moment
I was young and runnin' wide open
It was just another summer night
Had to be the last thing on my mind

When love broke thru
You found me in the darkness
Wanderin' thru the desert
I was a hopeless fool
Now I'm hopelessly devoted
My chains are broken
And it all began with You
When love broke thru
And it all began with You
When love broke thru

I did all that I could to undo me
But You loved me enough to pursue me
Yeah, You drew me out of the shadows
Made me believe that I mattered, to You (You)
You were there, You heard my prayer in that broke down dusty room
It was the first time I said, ""I'm Yours""
The first time I called You Lord

When love broke thru
You found me in the darkness
Wanderin' thru the desert
I was a hopeless fool
Now I'm hopelessly devoted
My chains are broken
And it all began with You
When love broke thru
And it all began with You
When love broke thru

Yeah, it was late in the summer when the northeast breeze
Sang like a song thru the oak trees
Pennsylvania
She kind of caught my soul
Which had me a little more open than closed
Walls I built
Opinions I learned
Covered in the ashes of bridges I burned
Blind to the arrow that headed to my heart
But You hit the mark

When love broke thru
You found me in the darkness
Wanderin' thru the desert
I was a hopeless fool
Now I'm hopelessly devoted
My chains are broken
And it all began with You
When love broke thru

You know Imma represent um, I ain't playin', can't afford to
I only got one life and I get it though
And this is not an act, not a movie, not a TV show
I don't know what quittin' means, I don't ever take it slow
You know I'm on the grind, me and Toby in the studio
Do it for the King, what you know about that?
Say you goin' harder, mmm I doubt that'
You say you doin' work, but you're asking where the couch at
How you doin' work when you asking where the couch at?
God is not a crutch, you can use Him when you wanna
You only look to heaven when you goin' through some drama
And when they goin' through some problems and that's the only time they call Him
I guess I don't understand that life, wonder why?
Cause' I'm all in
Til the day I die

Til the wheels fall off
Til the spotlight fades
I will lift your banner high
I will lift your banner high
And til the walls crash in
For the rest of my days
I'll lay it all on the line
Til the day I die
Til the day I die
Til the end of the line
Til the day I die
It's Your name I'll glorify"

I am tired, I am drained
But the fight in me remains 
I am weary, I am worn 
Like I’ve never been before 

This is harder than I thought 
Harder than I thought it’d be 
Harder than I thought 
Takin’ every part of me 
Harder than I thought 
So much harder than I thought it’d be 
But empty’s never felt so full 

This is what love (this is what love)
This is what love 
Feels like 
This is what love (this is what love) 
This is what love 
Feels like 
Poured out, used up, still givin’, 
stretching me out to the end of my limits 
This is what love (this is what love) 
This is what real love 
Feels like 
This is what love feels like poured out, 
used up still willin’ to fight for it 
This is what love feels like 
Yeah, this is what it feels like 

Like floating confetti 
The beautiful gets messy 
When the fall out finds the floor 
But in the depths of the trenches 
Is the richest of riches 
Love is calling us to more 

This is what love (this is what love)
This is what love 
Feels like 
This is what love (this is what love)

Feels like 
This is what love feels like poured out, 
used up still willin’ to fight for it 
This is what love feels like 
Yeah, this is what it feels like 

And now these three remain
Faith, hope and love 
But the greatest of these is love 

It’s worth everything you put in 
Everything you put in...
Love 
This is what it feels like

Poured out, used up, still givin’, 
stretching me out to the end of my limits

The Light of all the world
With the world on His shoulders
The weight of all our shame
On Him who knew no sin
A Holy surrender

The sky went dark
The Angels wept
The Father looked away

The final breath
He bowed His head
The lamb of God was slain

By His wounds I am set free
By His blood I've been redeemed
The great divide He crossed for me
Oh, praise the God of Calvary

On the hill of Calvary
Into the Father's hands
A Holy surrender

A borrowed tomb
His mother wept
And there His body lay
The stone was moved
He conquered death
And rose from the grave

By His wounds I am set free
By His blood I've been redeemed
The great divide He crossed for me
Oh, praise the God of Calvary

And if I never
Never lose sight of this place
I will never
Never lose sight of Your grace
The Cross is all
All I need to see
Oh, praise the God of Calvary

By Your wounds I am set free
By Your blood I've been redeemed
The great divide You crossed for me
Oh, praise the God of Calvary

Your Cross is all
All I need to see
Oh, praise the God of Calvary"

And I hope by Thy good pleasure, safely to arrive at home

He, to rescue me from danger, interposed His precious blood

How Your kindness yet pursues me, how Your mercy never fails me
Til the day that day shall lose me, I will sing, oh, I will sing

O to grace, how great a debtor, daily I'm constrained to be
Let thy goodness like a fetter, bind my wand'ring heart to Thee
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it, prone to leave the God I love
Here's my heart, Lord, take and seal it, seal it for Thy courts above

Christian,Elevation Worship,Here as in Heaven ,I Can't Believe ,"
In the fall you were there
Grace began before I was aware
The shame to great for me to hide
Covered now because of Jesus Christ

I can't believe
The price you paid for me
What you did not owe so that I could know you
How can it be
You chose someone like me
To declare your praise for the glory of your name

To the one who gave it all
I belong with all my heart and soul
And every gain I count as loss
When I survey the wonder of the cross

You gave your life upon the cross
To make your home within my heart
Oh what a faithful God you are
Your praise forever in my heart "

They're nothing anyway.
They're no better than me.
Out there you just have to fit into a pattern that somebody's already laid out for you.
Life we live, you have to set your own patterns, your own ideals.
You have to handle the whole job yourself. (Yeah)

No snow tires, the rain slip-slide like Trick Daddy and Trina
Oli North pull in, like, 10 million a season
Queen Street visions that nobody believed in
If we not on the charts, my XO niggas eatin'
Fifty-two consecutive weekends, shout out to Weeknd
The city gets stronger when everybody is speakin'
Not when everybody out here beefin'
We got it, now we just gotta keep it
America's most wanted, man, I'm still on the run
All these number ones and we still not the ones
No hard feelings, but I'll still get you spun
Went and got diplomas, and we still goin' dumb
Please never label niggas who lay down for a livin'
My competition, it's beyond offensive
I'm in it for the glory, not the honor mention
Not tryna be fourth and inches, I'm tryna go the distance
Yeah, distance, I'm on a different mission
This the remix to ""Ignition,"" hot and fresh out the kitchen
How you forget to fill up with gas on the road to riches?
Too overly ambitious, too late to fix it
Too late for condolences when it's over with
I need to start sayin' shit when I notice it
Be open with people I need some closure with
Be honest with myself and take ownership
Opinions started to burn when tables started to turn
I really used to feel like they loved a nigga at first
Excitin' times, revitalized
Trust this little light of mine is gonna shine positively
I'm just takin' what God will give me
Grateful like Jerry, Bob and Mickey
Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me
I know catchin' flies with honey is still sticky
I wrote the book on world-class finesses
And tasteful gestures and makin' efforts
And never placin' second
And even better knowin' you're first but then takin' second
Inspirin' and never takin' credit
I know I deserve more, I just never said it
Two middle fingers as I make a exit, yeah

Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?

Winnin' is problematic
People like you more when you workin' towards somethin'
Not when you have it
Way less support from my peers
In recent years as I get established
Unforgivin' times, but fuck it, I manage
Why is my struggle different than others'?
Only child that's takin' care of his mother
As health worsens and bills double
That's not respectable all of a sudden?
I don't get a pat on the back for the come up?
What do you see when you see me?
When did all the things I mean
From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?
Maybe I share it with too many people
Back then it used to just feel like our secret
Back when I would write
And not think about how they receive it
I be tryna manifest the things I needed
And look, now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me
But you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all
How they go from not wantin' me at all
To wantin' to see me lose it all?
Things get dark, but my aura just starts glowin'
I'm overcome with emotions
Ones I can't access when I'm stoned sober
Jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra
I could only speak what I know of
Man, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin'
And icy Heineken drinkin', and rival neighborhoods linkin'
And puttin' your trust in someone
With the risk of financially sinkin'
All you did was write the book on garbage-ass Rollies
Ego strokin', picture postin'
Claimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only
But you just had to show me
See, I know, 'cause I study you closely
I know when someone lyin'
I notice people standin' for nothin' and gettin' tired
I know what we're both thinkin' even when you're quiet

'Cause look at what we are
Your friends are scared to tell you you're in too far
Funny that it's always been all about you from the start
I met someone new last night and we kicked it
And I'm going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind, this time
Going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?

Out of body
That's just how I feel when I'm around you, shawty
Last night we didn't say it
But girl, we both thought it
Why second guess? I should have stayed
You say the word, I'm on the way
This shit feels like teenage fever
I'm not scared of it, she ain't either
Why second guess? I should have stayed
'Cause you know what's on my mind tonight

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?

Yeah, slightly took a left turn there
But very much 6AM
Slightly been awake for 24 hours, so please forgive me
More ideas and stuff comin'
Yeah, yeah, fam
I'm wafflin', but man is tired, fam, Jesus Christ"
Hip Hop/Rap,Drake,More LIfe ,KMT ,"(Ness on the beat)
Yeah
Okay, okay
Okay

B Man just got out the can
I gave my bro an advance (yeah)
Love is just not in my plans
Not even takin' a chance
Studio right in my yard
I'm doin' ten in a week
How long I been on this streak?
Dream about work in my sleep
Okay, I got a lock on the streets
Shoutout to T, he did three
And he brought it in 'cause of me
You don't know nothin' 'bout me
Life for my bruddas is deep
Long as they all on they feet
Long as they pockets is grease (grease!)
I'm in the penthouse, but still nothin' is sweet (yeah)
Dust a man down with the pen, it's a sweep (Mmmm!)
Taller in person, you'll see when we meet
I heard your new shit and I'm kissin' my teeth
(Jheeze)

Bringin' that dirty, dirty, bringin' that certy
Nizzy with the quick extension, ringin' off thirty
I've got bitches and they're murky, swervin', lookin' all curvy
And you already know I love them breasts, lookin' all perky
Lookin' all Christmas gift-wrapped, lookin' all turkey
Spend jumped out the Ghost in a suit, lookin' all churchy
Fingers all itchin', twitchin', lookin' all jerky
Whippin' that white girl, cookin' that Cersei
I'm just pushin' that dark shit, pushin' that charcoal
Now this is that big bad, this is Gustavo
Look at them jokers, look at that arsehole
Man are gettin' bread now, this is that hard dough
Clap man, dominant murder
I'm a black man, government earner
Could've just slapped man, but he wanted it further
Batman, da-na-na-da-na

October Firm"
Hip Hop/Rap,Drake,More LIfe ,Lose You ,"I don't care what society thinks. They're nothing anyway. They're no better than me. Out there you just have to fit into a pattern that somebody's already laid out for you. Life we live, you have to set your own patterns, your own ideals. You have to handle the whole job yourself. (Yeah)

No snow tires, the rain slip-slide like Trick Daddy and Trina
Oli North pull in, like, 10 million a season
Queen Street visions that nobody believed in
If we not on the charts, my XO niggas eatin'
Fifty-two consecutive weekends, shout out to Weeknd
The city gets stronger when everybody is speakin'
Not when everybody out here beefin'
We got it, now we just gotta keep it
America's most wanted, man, I'm still on the run
All these number ones and we still not the ones
No hard feelings, but I'll still get you spun
Went and got diplomas, and we still goin' dumb
Please never label niggas who lay down for a livin'
My competition, it's beyond offensive
I'm in it for the glory, not the honor mention
Not tryna be fourth and inches, I'm tryna go the distance
Yeah, distance, I'm on a different mission
This the remix to ""Ignition,"" hot and fresh out the kitchen
How you forget to fill up with gas on the road to riches?
Too overly ambitious, too late to fix it
Too late for condolences when it's over with
I need to start sayin' shit when I notice it
Be open with people I need some closure with
Be honest with myself and take ownership
Opinions started to burn when tables started to turn
I really used to feel like they loved a nigga at first
Excitin' times, revitalized
Trust this little light of mine is gonna shine positively
I'm just takin' what God will give me
Grateful like Jerry, Bob and Mickey
Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me
I know catchin' flies with honey is still sticky
I wrote the book on world-class finesses
And tasteful gestures and makin' efforts
And never placin' second
And even better knowin' you're first but then takin' second
Inspirin' and never takin' credit
I know I deserve more, I just never said it
Two middle fingers as I make a exit, yeah

Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?

Winnin' is problematic
People like you more when you workin' towards somethin'
Not when you have it
Way less support from my peers
In recent years as I get established
Unforgivin' times, but fuck it, I manage
Why is my struggle different than others'?
Only child that’s takin' care of his mother
As health worsens and bills double
That’s not respectable all of a sudden?
I don’t get a pat on the back for the come up?
What do you see when you see me?
When did all the things I mean
From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?
Maybe I share it with too many people
Back then it used to just feel like our secret
Back when I would write
And not think about how they receive it
I be tryna manifest the things I needed
And look, now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me
But you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all
How they go from not wantin' me at all
To wantin' to see me lose it all?
Things get dark, but my aura just starts glowin'
I'm overcome with emotions
Ones I can't access when I'm stoned sober
Jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra
I could only speak what I know of
Man, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin'
And icy Heineken drinkin', and rival neighborhoods linkin'
And puttin' your trust in someone
With the risk of financially sinkin'
All you did was write the book on garbage-ass Rollies
Ego strokin', picture postin'
Claimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only
But you just had to show me
See, I know, 'cause I study you closely
I know when someone lyin'
I notice people standin' for nothin' and gettin' tired
I know what we're both thinkin' even when you're quiet
Sometimes I gotta just make sure that I didn't lose you

Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?"
Hip Hop/Rap,Drake,More LIfe ,Can't Have Everything ,"Yeah, uh, man, fresh up out the sand
February 10, it's the boy, but I'm still the man
Come and get your mans
I don't know, first you caught the hands
Then you took the stand
It's a joke, but you say you real—I don't understand
On a yacht, me and all the dogs actin' like some dogs
We evolved, used to think vacation meant Niagara Falls
Swear to God, shout to Buffalo, never duckin' low
I don't stop, man, I'm stuck on go, always hug the row
Fuck a opp, make his body roll, yeah, a lot of those
Started out doin' college shows, Calipari flow
Then I popped like you never seen
We with everything, I went off in the '16, give me '17

Want a lot, can't have everything
Can't have everything
Want a lot, can't have everything
But I want everything

Bad attitude, tellin' who to calm down?
Tryna cool it all down
Who's callin' my name? Who's involved now?
Tell me who I gotta down, I'll do a song now, man
Even though there's way less to prove to y'all now, man
Everything that went around is comin' back around
Y'all better hit the ground
Goddamn, beef forever unfinished
Yeah, it's all open ended, had me off for a minute
Had you all since beginnin'
Damn, I must be coachin', 'cause I'm not playin' with them
Can you not see the difference?
I mean, I keep the fuckin' lights on in the buildin'
Man, my record deal should be 500 million, goddamn

Can't have everything
Can't have everything
Want a lot, can't have everything
But I want everything

Finally got my mind in a free state
Niggas tried to serve me up a cheesesteak
I gave them back a clean plate
Same niggas preein', 'cause they hate to see the team straight
Same niggas beakin' always duckin' my release date
That's when the phone starts ringin', like, “Are we straight?“
Two-faced nigga back around with the three face
Damn, oh, triple double, Russ face
Watch with the bust face
Never met the plug, but I rap about the plug face
Never met my self, I don't remember who I was face
Y'all fuckin' hilarious
Y'all really think you niggas teamin' up and scarin' us
Y'all niggas is arrogant, y'all sleep at the Sheraton
All that shit embarrassin'
Tell your big homie I'm all for goin' there again
He ain't even die and I ball with his inheritance
All that's in my account at the Bank of America
All that Drake hysteria
Six side, east side, all that for my area

You know, hun, I'm a bit concerned about this negative tone that I'm hearing in your voice these days. I can appreciate where your uncertainly stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel, as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust. But that attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you're going to continue to feel alienated. Give some thought to this, because I’m confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days. When others go low, we go high."
Hip Hop/Rap,Drake,More LIfe ,Glow ,"Watch out for me, I'm bound to glow
You better watch out for me, I'm bound to glow

Your boy all glowed up
Every time we touch down, bet it go up
'Member doin' shows, ain't nobody show up
Pour your heart out, ain't nobody show love
They used to laugh when my whip was on the tow truck
'Til me and bein' broke finally broke up
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow
Time to shake the dice, time to change the li-i-ight
No more 9 to 5, autopilot dri-i-ive
Used to work the fries, now we supersi-i-ize

Top down (I started out way down low)
Started from the bottom, now we here now

We about to get the whole nine
The whole nine, we just landed on a gold mine
We the new Abu Dhabi, this is our time

Watch out for me, I'm about to glow
I just take the dreams I've been sold
And sell 'em for more, you already know
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow

Hope I deal with karma 'fore my son do
'Cause I be drivin' round this bih with no sunroof
Man, the glow got me feelin' like I'm gunproof

Watch out for me, I'm about to glow
I still have my guard up
Blame this thing I'm part of
Tryin' to avoid more confrontation
I just gotta try harder
Takin' the time to clear my mind
'Cause soon as I'm able to let that go

Watch out for me, I'm bound to glow

Through devotion
Blessed are the children
We love y'all too!
We believe if there's anything y'all wanna do in life
You need devotion
Can I hear right on? (screams)

I know and I miss you
Know how to treat you, but it's difficult
Thank God I'm Christian
Remember how this all begun, just us
My mama said you was bad news, like ""dun-dun-dun-dun""
You proved her right, every single night
Oh my, oh my, can't close my eyes
Can't open my eyes, don't know what to do

Saturday to Saturday
You see that I've been goin' through it
Hopin' everything's okay
I just want to let you know
Everything these days is textual
I just want to get a little sexual, with you
Because I remember way, way back
With the waves under the wavecap
You were someone else's wife in fact
You didn't even look at me like that
Then it all just switched, over time
Step by step and you know what's next

Gotta let me know something
Wonder how you've been
I've been out in Bel-Air like Will was
These streets got so familiar
Malibu coast where I meditate
Book a plane home, then I hesitate
Scared to see what I left behind
It's weighin' heavy on my mind
And I can't help but wonder how you've been, baby
What are you on?

Dissin', but got pictures with me smilin' though
All the things you need, you still want problems though
All the things I know, I still been silent though
Yeah, used to be at SilverCity Indigo
Used to be in lunchroom, playin' dominoes
I don't want to have to go to funerals
I gotta start sleepin' at the studio
I don't have no time to be no Romeo
All the love I need is at the rodeo
All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah
All the girls I know are there with Ian Throw
Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?
Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on a rotary phone
I take a glass, it don't mean, ""Nah, don't go with me home.""
Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome
I need 40,000 people to see what I'm on
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
I was an angry youth when I was writin' Views
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
I'll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do
Steady doin' double shifts
1da doin' the beat and I open up like a double click
More blessings because I'm generous
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it
Can’t describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Wakin' up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep 'til morning on all my quiet nights
But you can rest assure that my mind is right
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV
To not even showin' up to a club 'less we doin' bis'
I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense
Especially people that want to lecture me, and frame it like they just want the best for me
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up
So there's more for them and there's less for me
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No one's done it successfully
7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
Swear I Told You that I'm in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping
Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
There's real ones around me
I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is set around competition and currency
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
I'll be back in 2018 to give you the summary

Moms stressed theres a lot of things we need

Hip Hop/Rap,Drake,More LIfe ,"Two Birds, One Stone ","Yeah, more, yeah

More time with family and friends, more life
More time to get it right
It's only me, but I'm seeing four shadows in the light
My demons visit me every night
To the most high, I'm forever indebted
I know I gotta pay somethin', I know that day's comin'
I put it all in the music
Because if I don't say it here, then I won't say nothin'
Could feel my hand getting tired from holding the grudges
Two birds, one stone, my aim is amazin'
I need to start losing my shit on you niggas that's hatin'
Too reserved, like I called ahead for me and my lady
Free C5, how the fuck we got the boss waiting?
Ever since the blue basement, I found God and I lost patience
Between rocks and hard places of all places
Spotted everywhere, like Dalmation
Cops snoop around now, 'cause all of my dogs famous
Please welcome the October fall baby
Vaughan Road Academy, star player—my mind's not all there
Used to carry a lot of dead weight like a pallbearer
People too scared to tell the truth, so it's all dares
Count it, it's all there, and we all square
Quick money, I'm in and out
My dad used to use a soap bar 'til it's thinnin' out
But, shit, look at Dennis now
All Stacy Adams and linnen'd out
More blessings for Sandy and him, more life
My parents never got it right
But God bless 'em both, I think we all alike
We all wide awake late at night, thinking on what to change
If we do get to do it twice in another life
Scared to go to sleep now
'Cause being awake is what all my dreams were like
Back when the bar that I had set for myself was out of sight
Tell me how I went and did chin-ups
On this shit when I can't see it
Pin-ups of Meagan Good and Pam Grier
Soul sisters inspired my old scriptures
Now that feeling's gone like them old pictures
Mixin' liquor got us both twisted, words get so vicious
You just stare at me while you roll Swishers
Girl, I love you, but I don't miss ya
And no matter what year it is, I'm a 06er
Go figure, cold nigga, stay in school, man
Fuck the rap game, it's all lies and it's all filthy
Two percent of us rich and the rest of these niggas all milk it
Got two of my niggas off with a ""not guilty""
Gave back to the city and never said it if I didn't live it
But still they try and tell you I'm not the realest
Like I'm some privileged kid
That never sat through a prison visit
Or like it was just handed to me tied with a ribbon
I never worked to get it
But really it's you with all the drug dealer stories
That's gotta stop, though
You made a couple chops and now you think you Chapo
If you ask me though, you ain't lining the trunk with kilos
You bagging weed watching Pacino with all your niggas
Like, ""This what we need to be on,"" but you never went live
You middle-man in this shit, boy, you was never them guys
I can tell, 'cause I look most of you dead in your eyes
And you'll be tryna sell that story for the rest of your lives
Can't show us where the cash is
Me, I don't judge, I'm just going off what the math is
Numbers inflated
They all look at me like, ""What have you done for me lately?""
""I like your older shit but wasn't in love with the latest.""
Aw, baby, stop debatin', I'm just a creative
My numbers out of this world
No wonder they got me feeling so alienated
You were the man on the moon
Now you just go through your phases
Life of the angry and famous
Rap like I know I'm the greatest
Then give you tropical flavours
Still never been on hiatus
You stay xann'd and perk'd up
So when reality set in, you don't gotta face it
I'm down 200 in Vegas but winning life on a daily basis
It seems like nobody wants to stay in my good graces
I'm like a real estate agent, putting you all in your places
Look what happens soon as you talk to me crazy
Is you crazy?"

Hold me down, either good or bad
Never switch, or act brand new
You go out your way and wasn't told to
So I made this song just for you

Made a deal that you wouldn't cross, lie to me
It was so many people that doubted me
Shit talk, shit talk, bullets startin' to let off

Blast off, blast off, my career gon' blast off
We don't need y'all, want y'all, we don't have to ask y'all

Ride through the city, yeah, the ball way
We was trappin', cappin' all through the hallway

Nobody thought that we would go up

Record man play my song on the radio
You too busy trying to find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I sweat too much on the regular
We gone let them hits fly, we gone let her go
If it ain't XO then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talking 'bout a face numbing off a bag a blow
I'm like goddamn bitch I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn bitch I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these RnB niggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick she go low mane

Said I'm just tryna swim in something wetter than the ocean
Faded off a double cup, I'm mixing up the potion
All I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit
It just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit
Everybody knows it, all these niggas know me
Platinum off a mixtape, sipping on that codeine
Pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed
I'mma keep on singing while I'm burning up that OG
All my niggas get it they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck, making sure I'm getting home
When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil a show
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk around with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight
Eating all day, tryna lose weight
That good sex, we'll sweat it out
Hotel bed springs we'll wear it out
I ain't gotta tell you 'cause

Grew up with no father so nobody ever ""son"" me
My flow too sick, Kevin Costner couldn't touch me
I know you wish that nobody ever love me
I feel useless when I'm never making money

[Verse 1]
It has begun again, my friend
In this room, we are nothing but strangers in a bed
You made me fall again, my friend
How can I forget when you said love was just pretend?

[Pre-Chorus]
Well I told her I've been thinkin' 'bout her lately
But she told me that to love her is so crazy

[Chorus]
'Cause she loves to lay
(No) I learned the hard way
(Oh) She loves to lay, I'm all to blame
I learned the hard way
(Oh) She loves to lay
(Move it out, now) Know I learned the hard way
(Move it out, now) She loves to lay, it's all a game
I learned the hard way
(Move it out, now)

[Verse 2]
It has begun again, my friend
In your heart, we are nothing but strangers in the end

(Oh) She loves to lay, I'm all to blame

(Move it out, now) Know I learned the hard way
(Move it out, now) She loves to lay, it's all a game
I learned the hard way
(Move it out, now)

[Bridge]
I feel there's someone else
Worth your time, from the start
He's just one call away
From your mind, and your heart
It has begun, begun
Again, again, my friend, hey!

[Chorus]
'Cause she loves to lay
(She loves to lay)
I learned the hard way
(No, I learned the hard way)
She loves to lay, I'm all to blame
I learned the hard way
(Woah-oh)
She loves to lay
(Move it out, now)
Know I learned the hard way
(Move it out, now)

Fingers letting go of the wheel when I cum
Whe-wheel when I cum, whe-wheel when I cum

Like I'm James Dean, I'ma die when I'm young
Die when I'm young, die when I'm young

Heaven knows that I've been told
Paid for the life that I chose
If I could, I'd trade it all
Trade it for a halo

'Cause I think it's safe to say...""

Cross on my neck, cross on my neck

Do a buck 20, I'ma fly off the edge
Everybody said it would hurt in the end
Hurt in the end, but I feel nothin'

Lit a cigarette, stepped out the door, had an appearance
Drank more

I can't even leave my bedroom so I keep pouring
And I ain't seen a light of days since, well that's not important
It's been long

[Bridge]
And I was feeling Whitney, me and my homies sipping Houston
Cars and clothes thought I was winning, you knew I was losing
You told me to wake up, oh my clock always stays on snooze and I'm done

[Chorus]
To each their own and found peace in knowing
Ain't always broken, but here's to hoping
Show no emotion, against the cold
And just act as hard as you can
You don't need a friend, boy you're the man

[Post-Chorus]
Oo oo oo oo oo oo oo

[Verse 2]
And I've been looking for someone that I can buy my drugs from
It seems like every plug ran east to Utah, became Mormons Drought comes around, feels like I have no one to depend on
Sober, ugh
I had 80 beers on Tuesday night, I had nothing to do with it
I put on a little Dwight and sang a happy tune and
Lit a cigarette, stepped out the door, had an appearance
Drank more

[Chorus]
To each their own and found peace in knowing
Ain't always broken, but here's to hoping

Do I really need an intro
Cause dey know, dey know, dey know
Do I really need an intro
Who I am, Who I am, Who I am
Do I really need an intro
Dey know, dey know, dey know
Do I really need an intro
Who I am, Who I am, Who I am

All I get is respect, as soon as I eject the vehicle
I bet you cannot detect, the scratch of a defect
From where the streets feast at, but made it out the belly of the beast without a C-sect
I'm so straight up, I'm so erect
Hype off that action, I'm so direct
I know it's a hundred thousand niggas up in Michigan
Doing it, but where I lack in talent I make up for it in discipline
And go hard, so hard til nobody else is on my sonar, radar, or lane cause I Bogart
Nowadays all we do is classic, Mozart
Outta here, it would be polite to send a postcard

I meant a post heart, yall niggas post hard
So lost co-star, coast off au revoir
I mean look at all we been in
And I look up in the mirror like boy you aint even finished

(Chorus)

Do they really need my info, to show them what they in for
I'm recognized like kinfolk, even when my brim low
I come from where that life talk, where dat where dat knife talk
D-town, be brown, more money than white chalk
and on them nights how we grind til its light out
grind til the sunset, til my grandson set, yup
yeah, man my kids gone have the good life
good days, good nights, and not the wish I could life
strongest survive it, they see he trying to make something outta nothing
they like damn he Macgyver
Damn he go live, but too good to try and let up
and im better than whoever put together

Hip Hop/Rap,Big Sean,I Decided. ,The Light ,"[Intro]
Uh-huh, is it time?

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Look, I spent my whole life trying to improvise
I'm not saying that shit for you to sympathize
Spent my whole life tryna find the light that's at the end of the tunnel
I should have realized it was inside
So lately I been trying to get what's inside outside
So many people wanna see my insides outside
I'm from that city four hours east of Southside
Where everyone outside, but don't fuck with no outsiders
Going up, with the ones I hold it down with
Whole city got my back on some photobomb shit
Whole city blowing up on some old Saddam shit
Before this I was the one hoes tried to go to prom with
You know, take the fame, take the crib
Take our cars, now we gotta take the train
Hood niggas takin' chains, slave master take our names
5-0 take the shot, and young souls take the blame
Man but they can't take away the light

[Hook: Jeremih & Big Sean]
No matter how much they gon' shade you
No, man they can't fuck with the light
They can't stop the shine
They can't fuck with the light, hell nah the boy's that bright
Even if you take away my life, you can't take the light
No matter how much they gon' shade you

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Got the whole city on fire
Boy, this the flow that got Steph Curry inspired
This the flow that got Lebron James finna rewire
This the flow that got my whole family finna retire
Flows on flows, I might drown in this bitch
Ye found a pro, I guess I'm profound in this bitch
My dad from Louisiana, man the smallest town
Where if they know you brown, they might hold you down
And even hose you down, man
Since I'm a son, I feel like I gotta stunt hard
I took the hand that they gave me and played the Donald Trump card
And realized counting money never feel as good as counting blessings
And a loaded mind is more dangerous than a loaded weapon
So when they take the fame, take the crib
Take our cars, now we gotta take the train
Hood niggas takin' chains, slave master take our names
5-0 take the shot and young souls take the blame
Man, but they can't take away the light

[Hook: Jeremih & Big Sean]
No matter how much they gon' shade you
No, man they can't fuck with the light
They can't stop the shine
They can't fuck with the light, hell nah the boy's that bright
Even if you take away my life, you can't take the light
No matter how much they gon' shade you

Don't let them take away your soul
No, no (no, no)
Don't let them take away what makes you whole"

Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me cause I’m homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me ‘lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like an edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be s-shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I’m never on some switching sides shit

Only thing that sold out is the seats though (Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I’m on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I’m Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga I don’t act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot “count to ten” me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen court rooms and court sides, ain’t too many seen both sides
Nigga fuck what you know
Nigga I’m takin' back control

I'm about gettin' my logo all flooded with ice
I'm about takin' a risk that might fuck up your life
Tell 'em point and shoot like camera crews
In front of cameras too (Brrr!)
Damn, Sean, what happened to the humble attitude?
I'm like, ""Niggas took the flow, but I'm still standin' too.""
Thought I had the Midas touch, and then I went platinum too
Motherfuck all your comparisons
I've been talkin' to God like that's my therapist
I'm African-American in America; I ain't inherit shit
But a millionaire under 30, so He must be hearin' shit
Don, don, don life, I do this for the crib, the D to Flint
Kids who get sick with lead, others get hit with the lead
From where they need a handout
But they tell you put hands up
Only deals I had was from the Sam's Club
Now it's blue blood in my veins
Though you know what I came for
Born in a world goin' where they told me I can't go
In my lane, though, I'm in the same boat as Usain Bolt
Get ahead by any means, so the head's what I aim for
When my grandma died I realized I got an angel
Show me everything's a blessing, dependin' on the angles
Look, I am the anomaly, never needed favors or apologies
That's my new lifetime policy
Woodgrain steering wheel, this bitch feel like a pirate ship
How many hot verses 'til you bitches start acknowledgin'
The pictures we been paintin'? My nigga
Connected to a higher power—how I know?
'Cause I don't write this shit, I think it, my nigga
Look, all I ever did was beat the odds
'Cause when you try to get even it just don't even out
Never stoppin' like we hypnotized
Watch what we visualize on the rise
Be the GOAT while we alive; when we die, we gon' be the gods

If she was flavor, I won't save her
No taste buds, ho, later!
Fuck you lookin' at, hater?
I saw them eyes, like an ass raper
Try to copy my swag like a cheating classmate
I'll be the last face you see before you pass
When you get your fuckin' ass graded like a math paper
So ahead of my time, ""late"" means I'm early
My age is reversing, I'm basically thirty
Amazingly sturdy, zany and wordy
Brainy and nerdy, blatantly dirty
Insanely perverted, rapey and scurvy
They blame me for murdering Jamie Lee Curtis
Said I put her face in the furnace, beat her with a space heater
A piece of furniture, egg beater, thermos
It may be disturbing, what I'm saying's cringeworthy
But I'm urinating on Fergie, call Shady number 81
Surely I'm turning into the Aaron Hernandez of rap
State of emergency, the planet's having panic attacks
Brady's returning, matter of fact I may be deserving
Of a pat on the back, like a Patriots jersey
Inexplicable stomach growl from the pit of it
Like a fuckin' Terrier hid in it
Despicable, dumb it down, ridiculous
Tongue is foul, shoot off at the fuckin' mouth
Like a missile, a thunder cloud
Hundred pound pistol, pull the trigger, this gun will sound
And you'll get a round, like Digital Underground
And fuck Ann Coulter with a Klan poster
With a lamp post, door handle, shutter
A damn bolt cutter, a sandal, a can opener, a candle, rubber
Piano, a flannel, sucker, some hand soap, butter
A banjo and manhole cover
Hand over the mouth and nose smother
Trample ran over the tramp with the Land Rover
The band, the Lambo, Hummer and Road Runner
Go ham donut, or go Rambo, gotta make an example of her
That's for Sandra Bland, ho, and Philando
Hannibal on the lamb, no wonder I am so stubborn
I'm anti, can't no government handle a commando
Your man don't want it, Trump's a bitch
I'll make his whole brand go under (Yeah)
And tell Dre I'm meeting him in L.A.
White Bronco like Elway, speeding
I'm bout to run over a chick, Del Rey CD in?
Females stay beatin ‘em, bet you they'll lay bleeding
And yell, ""Wait!"" pleading—but screaming is pointless
Like feeding Michel'le helium
Leaving them pale-faced, medium-sized welt
Straight treating 'em like a cellmate
Seedy, I'm climbing hell's gate
Bitch, I'm like your problems: self-made
Meaning someone else's help ain't needed, 'cause I'ma…

[Hook: Big Sean]
Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors
What I need? No favors
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors

""Hey, I'm outside.""
What are you doing here?"
Hip Hop/Rap,Big Sean,I Decided. ,Voices in My Head ,"Part 1: ""Voices in My Head""

[Hook]
Voices in my head sayin' I could do better, damn
Voices in my head sayin' that I knew better
(You know better, what the fuck!)
I done seen this shit happen a hundred times on the regular
But I still crossed the line like I'm blind, damn
Voices in my head saying I could do better
(You always do the same shit)

[Verse]
This was supposed to be the last time, last hit
Last call, last feel, last trip, last run
That's what I always tell myself, huh, damn
This was supposed to be the last one, last two
Last flip, last you, last me, last night
Doing every single thing my parents warned me about
(You're a fucking disappointment) 'Til I wore 'em out, shit

[Hook]
Voices in my head saying I could do better
(Voices in my head saying that I could do better)
Voices in my head saying that I knew better
I done seen this shit happen a hundred times on the regular
But I still, fuck
(That's your problem, you don't listen!)

Part 2: ""Stick to the Plan""

[Bridge]
Voices in my head, conscience talking to me like
Look (Metro Boomin want some more, nigga!)

[Hook]
Stick to the plan, stick to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan, to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan

[Verse 1]
Stay focused
Don't let these niggas see your emotions
Stick to the notion, stay in motion
Remember soon as you stand still
So will everything else you notice
Make sure all your inner actions end with actions
If you stacking fronting and back in
Subtract if it isn't adding
Plus who hurt you don't let back in
Plan it out, yeah, tit for tat it
Extra pussy get distracting
Put that into what's worth having (boy)

[Hook]
Stick to the plan, stick to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan, to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan

[Verse 2]
Stay focused
Pay attention who you getting close with
Distance yourself from negative energy
Voices in my head, they say it's meant for me
I, I, I, you in my way, bitch it's no sympathy
I, I, I, been plotting this since elementary
I, I, I, no you need to buckle down
Have people asking where you at
And wondering why you never wanna come around
You know that effort gon' come around
Big face like Zordon
You bought the watch but can't afford the time
Even if you running out of breath
Weight of the world doing lots of reps
Time to get this generation
Last one and then the next two outta debt
And they gon' pay you back with respect
Just stick to the plan, still we can chill
Back when I rocked the white and blue Grant Hills
I realized there's no dream that I can't fill
I manifested all while I'm the man still
(Bitch I'm the man)

[Verse 3]
Voices in my head attacking what I'm thinking
Bullet to the head might be the way to free it
If I leave my body I can free the spirits
Swear to God my death of fear just keep on shrinking
Wishing I could go back to the nineties
Back when I was dreaming
Me and my dog was on a mission like we Kel and Kenan
Early 2000s Detroit might as well been the hell with demons
Wondering when I started it, the losing grip
Feeling like I'm in the middle of the ocean
You either drown or canoe through it
Voices in my head said I'm used to it
Some help me to lose and some help me maneuv' through it
When I talk to myself I'm confused on who's who it
I know in life you either blow it or blew it
And at the end of life it's gonna feel like you flew through it
I just hope by then I cut the voices in my head"

Silly, silly, thinking that the negativity you talking could ever fuck up the tranquility

Hip Hop/Rap,Big Sean,I Decided. ,Sunday Morning Jetpack ,"[Hook: Big Sean]
Thank you God for all my set backs
'Cause he the reason I'm able to get back
This feels like my Sunday morning jetpack
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back, whoa
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back
This feels like my Sunday morning jetpack, yeah

[Verse: Big Sean]
This the feeling know that I've been missing some days
This feel like I'm headed to paradise one way
This feel like the family dinners that we used to have on Sunday
With Grandma in the kitchen making rum cake
Or this spread she used to do for Thanksgiving, man
This feels like the first time I heard Killa Cam
Pink Timb's, in the Lamb
Mixing it in with Dilla and
Headphones to the ceiling fan
Bucket hat like Gilligan, yeah
Lately I've been talking to ghosts
Didn't learn faith in school but that's what I'm testing the most
You know I still rep you when you're gone though
I got a picture of us on the front lawn
With me, grandma and mom, that night I went off to prom
Wishin' you could see the lights all dijon and parmesan
Funny thing about it is you always act like you knew
You told me how you were feeling before it happened, before it do
And you taught me I'm a product of everything I go through
And you and grandma went broke so we would never get bruised
You the reason that I ever touched my first Franklin
Fast forward, I'm in Kanye crib with Kirk Franklin
It reminded me of how we always used to dress up as a family
And go to Sunday service, and being in church, singin'
Ain't been to church in awhile
But it ain't just about how you just praise him in the building
It's about how you praisin' him while you out
You taught me to remember that when I get set back
Been through the worst times to get the best back
Wishin' for a time machine to jet back
To my all time low self and throw me a jetpack, woah
And see you again, needless to say
Back when I dated Alisha, Simone
Or any other girl who looked like Lisa Bonet
Who was jealous of me and Jhené
Who you would always advise with me being away
You was right, but I had to learn for myself
I guess a time came for me to earn for myself
I hope that this is somewhat of a thank you for all your help
Hope the angels take care of you until I see you myself

[Bridge: The-Dream]
Praise, so many times I prayed for you
I put up prayers for you
Praise, for all the times that you prayed for me
All the nights you stayed by me
All the nights that you cried and all the days I coulda died
Because of you I survived, because of you I'm still alive

[Hook: Big Sean]
Thank you God for all my set backs
'Cause he the reason I'm able to get back
This feels like my Sunday morning jetpack
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back, whoa
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back
This feels like my Sunday morning jetpack, yeah

You do the right thing, you know you inspire me (you, you, you)

[Verse 1]
You tried to keep me away from temptation
Introduced me to The Temptations
Marvin Gaye and Isley Brothers
Dancing so hard the living room shaking
Yeah we dance in the house
My mama's the man of the house
Mama you too good for them men
Even dad, you too good for him
Mama you know you inspire me
You deserve early retirement
You text me, tell me to take my vitamins
When I got a new love you invite 'em in
When we break up, you don't like 'em then (no)
Loyal, loyal, swear you super loyal
Worth more to me than striking oil
You deserve the life I'm tryna show ya
I remember all of the sacrifices
Growing up in debt, but never hungry
Rich in everything except money
That's that faith that you can't buy
But I buy that new crib, you look right in it
I buy that new car in the color that you like it in
And play my song every single time you drive in it
That's 'cause you inspired it (yeah)

I'm busy like every other time
Since I got a house in that other town
You wonder when I'ma come around
I know you worry about me
I give you attitude like, ""Don't worry 'bout it""
Don't hit ya up like I don't care about you
But I hold you down, I swear I got you
I know I got problems communicating
I probably should've went to school
And got that degree in communications
I should be with you on vacation
I should take you where you should be taken
Asia, Africa, Dubai, anything you want, I do buy
Just want you to know I do try
To take care of ya, mama you the one, you the one
You the moon, you the stars, you the sun
I'm so happy I'm your son
I'm so happy I'm your son
You love me since day one
Since before day one
So before the day's done
I gotta, gotta let you know

You do the right thing, you know you inspire me
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me
Can't go wrong, wrong, wrong

Look, mama, you know you inspire me
If I ever made you not feel like it, then this is my apology
So sorry, look, dear mama you know your son shine for ya
I'm Sean for ya, my lady
Don't you ever let 'em talk to you crazy
Anything for the fam, how you raise me

That chemistry means way more than anatomy
She mad at me, she been mad at me

'Cause actually, I realized time's the most valuable, actually
So I'ma call my favorite girl and she gon' bring that ass for me
And as for me, I'ma text the room number right now
So you ain't gotta hit the front desk and go ask for me
Don't ask for me, don't ask for me

You need separation, you need recreation
Y'all been arguing every other day
Ya friends gotta step in and break it up like chill, chill, chill
It's no need to turn this into Kill Bill, look
Funny we ran into each other while we leaving
You walked in with a perm

Long nights, no reply
I got no regrets, you disrespect, disrespect
Only time I seen you now is on the internet
Just to see if it's somebody else that you tied to
I hit you back when I decide to
You got my tattoo, we was tribal
Then you left and we turned rivals
Now you back, it's our revival
They don't make you feel like I do
They didn't make you perform for me
You was my American Idol how you rocked the mic
Man, we went from long text, now they shorter than a haiku
Seems like all you got is hate for me
All you ever did was take from me

Can I hit it like I crash? Sipping pinot by the glass
Honestly I had to take the time to let my ego go
Realized that that held us back and back's not where we need to go
This don't replace what you did to me

Sometimes it ain't about what we did or didn't do
It's about what we getting through

Knowing that we both want the same thing

I pray that you get it even if I can't get it with cha
I pray to God you never let the little things in life distract you from the bigger picture
Everybody in the city to me like a distant cousin, brother, little sister
I see myself in the young ones
When I look in their eyes it feel like a mirror
Corleone all on my own (Don)
Cartier all on my arm
All I hear is sirens and car alarms
Niggas going to war with no armor on
First time I seen a dead body I was 14
And I felt the pressure
Like if I don't get it, I might end up next to him
I'ma take the dice and I'ma roll a 7
Seven, seven, seven, 7-11 it's 911 getting called around
The hood America's lost and found
Where niggas get lost and never found
All I ever wanted was to turn these Gs into Ms and a Mercedes key
Got it and still felt incomplete
That's when I realized this shit was bigger than me

[Hook: Big Sean & Flint Chozen Choir]
Bigger than me
When the whole town on their feet
And they all just waiting on you to speak
That's when you realize that this is bigger than me
All I wanna do is make the city proud, yeah
Wishing all the OGs could see me now, now, yeah
Ohhh ya ya yeah
Ohhh ya ya yeah
You gon' realize that this was bigger than me

[Post-Hook: Starrah]
Used to want that foreign
Got that foreign, now it's boring
Started touring
Swear to God that's when I realized this shit was bigger than me
Flex on niggas with a Rollie
Got that Rollie with the shine
But lost my time
That's when I realized this shit was bigger than me

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I seen people in the same place 10 years later
Man that shit pathetic
God talking to me telepathic like it only happen if you let it
I can't spend my whole life looking at the same ceiling fan
When I feel like I ain't got no ceilings man
If I ain't special why I feel it then?
I gotta get on the road
I gotta be the one chose
I gotta come back and tell the greatest story they never told
This must be the feeling that you get when you know you close
And you know it's a way in even when the doors are closed
And realize this shit is bigger than me yeah

[Hook: Big Sean & Flint Chozen Choir]
Bigger than me
When the whole town on their feet
And they all just waiting on you to speak
That's when you realize that this is bigger than me
All I wanna do is make the city proud, yeah
Wishing all the OGs could see me now, now, yeah
Ohhh ya ya yeah
Ohhh ya ya yeah
Ohhh ya ya yeah

[Outro]
[Myra Anderson:] Well no matter what, I'm proud of you. Even when you do stupid things that I have warned you about. You must get that from your daddy. I'm just kidding, you know I love you. You listening?
[Big Sean:] Yeah yeah, I'm listening. I love you too
[Myra Anderson:] In a way I feel like I'm living through you. Sometimes it feels like I got another chance at everything
[Big Sean:] Man that's deep to feel like that. I kinda feel the same way though sometimes
[Myra Anderson:] Yeah
[Big Sean:] With all the work that's goin' on I feel like this is like my second time doin' it so I know that sound crazy but, you know I just I don't know why I always imagine myself as like someone who failed at everything he ever did at life you know and I got to the end of life and just regretted it all and somehow, this is my chance to go back and get it all right. And when I wake up, with that mindset, you know, it completely changes my hunger, how I approach the whole day. I mean you decide to live your life like that then pshh man I guarantee we'll live life to our best potential
[Big Sean (future self):] It's that simple. It's all about living in the moment. Period"

Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out

Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone
Why you always touching road
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
You was in the zone, yeah
You should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

Hip Hop/Rap,Drake,Views ,Keep the Family Close ," Produced By Maneesh


[Intro]
It's a little chilly out there
How you can stand there is beyond me

[Hook]
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore

[Verse 1]
Always saw you for what you could've been
Ever since you met me
Like when Chrysler made that one car that looked just like the Bentley
I always saw you for what you could've been
And even when it's business with you it's personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet and now we're meeting our end

[Bridge]
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

[Verse 2]
You're so predictable I hate people like you
Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you
How you supposed to figure out what I'm going through
You can't even figure out what's going on with you
You judge me 'fore you met me yeah it figures
I make all the player's anthems for the real niggas
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong
Out here in L.A. I don't know what's going on
I don't know what's going on

[Bridge]
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

[Verse 3]
You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
My luck is a sure thing cause I'm living right
When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice
But you always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
I'm fooding and serving them all like I'm working for minimum wage
Someone up there must just love testing my patience
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
Forgiveness for your ways
If I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya that's how I was raised
Same way I'm right here still feeling the way
Same way I'm realizing on a day to day

[Hook]
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need your family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore
Much closer

[Outro]
Anytime people want to start problems
It's like “for real, are you dumb?”

[Intro]
Yeah, for the dogs dem, you know
Man when shit gets like this, in the whole city
Shit's crazy right now, this shit ain't gonna stop
You know shit gonna get a lot more worse before it get any better

[Verse 1]
Look
Momma hit my phone and said rap's no good
Better than her telling me the check's no good
Now they wanna act like I do no good
Funny cause I really did more than I should
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
Can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
You know 40 wants peace, but I'm down to cut ties for it
And I can't sleep these days unless I take one
If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it
Doesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it
They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it
Same way, breads gotta break for it
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now
And I turn the six upside down, it's a nine now
I made a decision last night that I would die for it

[Hook]
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)

[Verse 2]
All these hand outs, man it's getting outta hand
I'mma start telling niggas ""Get it how you can""
I got it right now so I'm everybody's friend
If I ever lose I bet we never speak again
I made a decision last night that I'd die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
First place, first place, man we can't be tied for it
I only drove it five times, paid 1.5 for it
Keychain go jang-a-lang, I wanna do major things
MJ in every way, I just don't fade away
Six upside down, it's a nine now
Like Mannie, like Stunna, man, shit is big time now
And I made a decision last night that I would die for it

(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)

[Outro]
Make me feel the same way that I did to you
Trust me when I say I'll go without you
Trust me when I say that shit is old moves
God made himself a way from me to you
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views
Tried to kill me but I am very much alive on the six side

[Intro: DMX]
What these bitches want from a nigga?

[Verse 1]
On some DMX shit
I group DM my exes
I tell 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever
And I think we just get closer when we not together
You tell me that I'm confusin'
More immature than Marques Houston
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution
We too deep in this thing to never lose me
LOLOL I'm glad you find this shit amusin'
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars
That's why she's always correctin' me when my time is off
And my house is the definition
Of alcohol and weed addiction
You got a different vision
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen
Without runnin' into one of my niggas
That's not the way we livin'
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people
But every time we speakin'

[Hook]
It's like a lot of games bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
It's like a lot of games are bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs
Where you're getting me
All that grey in our conversation history, you
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things
Playin' mime games, we both doin' the same thing
Slide on a late night
You like to slide on a late night
You send the ""are you here?"" text without an invite
That's that shit that I don't like
We both slide on a late night
Do things in our off time
We both, yeah
Made some mistakes, pon road
Yeah, how's that for real?
You toyin' with it like Happy Meal
3 dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still
While you're typin' make sure you tell me

[Hook]
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

[Verse 3]
Remember you was livin' at The London for a month
Service elevator up to 4201
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front
Girl I had your back when all you used to do was front
That's for sure though, I made a career off reminiscin'
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade they throwin'
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need
And on my way to make this dough
A lot of niggas cut the cheque so they can take this flow
A lot of niggas cut the cheque so they can take this flow, Ohhh, ohhh!
Tryna give your ass the world
You runnin' your fingers through my curls
You knew me when the kid had waves
But that's enough of that
You could never say I came up and forgot about your ass
And that's some real shit"

Despite the things you said to me
Who is it that's got you all gassed up?
Changing your opinion on me
I was only gone for the last few months
But you don't have the time to wait on me

[Hook]
I try with you
There's more to life than sleeping in
And getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're trying to make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose

Boss up, I'm the bigger homie
But I'm one year older than my lil homie

But off verses, he been blackin'
Chasin' women a distraction
They wan' be on TV right next to me
You cannot be here right next to me
Don't you see Riri right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same, but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point in even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

6 cold like Alaska
Views already a classic
Roy outta here like NASA
Bustin' 1's out the plastic
Her gram too poppin' to fuck her
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious
I feed my family with this
So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious
I don't run out of material
You shouldn't speak on me, period
You try to give 'em your side of the story
They heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it
They feeling a way and won't hide it
Niggas done being silent
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point of even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially

[Verse]
One of dem ones
Right
Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny
Back when we couldn't buy pizza cause we were down to pennies
Feel like we go back a century, run in the store for Centuries
Then bring it back to your brother man we had to respect it
He was wavy doin' mixtapes out of your basement
He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him
Feel like I never say much but man there's a lot to know
Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show
I'm lookin at they first week numbers like what are those
I mean you boys not even coming close
I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy we tradin' places
Lookin' in the mirror I'm closer than I really appear
Creepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care
No tender love and care and no love and affection
I got a price on my head but there's a risk to collect it
I might be here as a vessel to teach people the lesson
Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together
Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester
40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure
A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings fadin'
A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation
Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day
You treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday
You don't be scorin' perfect, you don't be workin' like how we be workin'
You platinum like wrappers on Hershey's boy that shit is worthless
You get the message over and over like it was urgent
And then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person
The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in
And did it with a purpose
Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships
Nowadays they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension
A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned
Shout out to KD we relate we get the same attention
It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder
The most successful rapper 35 and under
I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under
That's when I plan to retire, man it's already funded
Yeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin
She violated, I sent her back to where it all started
How quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment
Leave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness
Told my momma that I found a lady in the east
Cancun, when I got signed they upgraded the suite
Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free
I get you all you can eat, just have some patience with me
You wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique
Last time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats
I used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti Treat
Now the talk of the corner store is that I'm TBE
The best ever, don't ever question, you know better
But shit ain’t how it always seems when it’s sewn together
Yeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it
Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled
Don't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal
Don't let your newfound fame fool you or cloud up your judgement
To talk loosely, I really do this
Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit
Drinkin' Hpnotiq with Glenn Lewis I been through it
Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it
Too busy face screwin' on waste movements
You was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin'
First take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it
And they still take to it
Big Apple had the white hummer parked right in front of Fluid
And we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it
But money can't buy happiness, Jellee talkin' truthful
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want
Get high when I want
Yeah, that's right
Yeah"

I get it

[Verse 1]
Why would I say all these things to have you feelin' a way?
Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?
Why do I settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces?
Why do I want an independent woman to feel like she needs me?
I lost my way

[Chorus]
I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Please give me time

Run your mouth, I'd rather listen to someone else
I gave your nickname to someone else
I know you're seein' someone that loves you
And I don't want you to see no one else
I don't want you here with no one else
I don't wanna do this with no one else
I used to know you back when you was young
Your brother brought me through, you saw me
That made me think of you so differently
I miss the feeling of you missing me

Say to you
But 80 percent of it was the truth, yeah
Say to you
A Mercedes coupe that you're still drivin' was for me and you
Girl, really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you
Clicked up with Jessica, Kim, you know that I'm bound to see you
And they both say that you're over and done with me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah

Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you
Aw please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now

[Verse 4]
Damn, I'm not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syn had a baby and treated me different
Erika sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they wish it could've been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven
Tryna satisfy everybody
It's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough
And then it's too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?
Since Take Care, I've been caretakin'
But second chances, that ain't how you livin'
Redemption on your mind, I'll never be forgiven

Looking for things you can find
Just so you can have something to bring up when it's time
Mixing vodka and emotions, tapping into your emotions
Dry cry cause I'm hopeless
Choose your lover for the moment
Different story when I leave you
Story up just to keep you
I need you around, I need you, oh

Have you coming all summer like a season pass
I want to turn you out like pitch black
Want to watch you do work while I sit back

I don't know how to ask you if you're okay
My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier than us these days
Yeah, these days I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently

Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it

How long did we last?
I feel bad for asking
It can't end like this
We gotta take time with this
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Let me see if this is something I can fix
You got somebody other than me
Don't play the victim when you're with me
Free time is costing me more than it seems
Sacrificing things
And I wanna tell you my intentions
I wanna do the things that I mention
I wanna benefit from the friendship
I wanna get the late night message from you, from you
I put my hands around you
Gotta get a handle on you
Gotta get a handle on the fact that...

[Verse 3]
I figure out you, you figure out me
We both a different breed
I'm followin' your lead, I ask you what you need
You say ""a guarantee""
I mean you say that like it's easy
You never believe me
Told you I got Zs for these other girls sleepin' on 'em
Girl I'm sleepy
Sometimes I'm so indecisive

[Chorus]
But you a real ass woman and I like it
I don't wanna fight it

[Outro]
I give you my all
I dedicate, I dedicate, woah yeah
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, baby, dedicate
I dedicate to you
I dedicate, I dedicate
This song's for you

[Intro: The Winans]
Question is will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no, no, no, no
Question is will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no, no, no, no

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure
And my wifey is a spice like I'm David Beckham
A lot of pent up aggression coming out of my section
OVO on me while y'all niggas was playing dress-up
And I know who gon' take the fall with me
They right here on call with me, they all with me
You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted
They been saying it's love, but it isn't love, is it?
Toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me
I worked at Jaydees Connections whenever Jason let me
Ceesay’s, I was buying fitteds everyday
Kiddie's Caribana trying not to catch a stray
I dropped out right before I graduate
Six credits left, my mama had her saddest day
""It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait""
And she took my word for it, that's all I had to say
Lately I just feel so out of character
The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance
Thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist
I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison
I'm getting straight to the point with it
Need y'all to know that I never needed none of y'all niggas
Fuck being all buddy buddy with the opposition
It's like a front of the plane, nigga, it's all business
But I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute

[Verse 2]
Look, they'd rather run up on me than towards them goals
My niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below
Who you think running this show?
You saw it in me at 20 years old
The lingo start to sound like we talking in code
I got a pure soul, I don't do the hate
You don't worry 'bout fitting in when you custom made
Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change
Now me and Kobe doing shots the night before the game
Still drop 40 with liquor in my system
Numbers going unlisted just to create some distance
I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya
Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian
Lamborghini got me feeling like I'm Christian Bale
And I never bend my morals for the ticket sales
Tipping scales, bars heavy like triple XL
I never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself
Running through the 6, thumbing through the contracts
I'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts
They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon
I still got something left to prove since you left me room
Paint a plan for the family debt, we in the minus
And like it's going in a trunk, I put it all behind us
Where you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever
I'm a staple in the game, all my papers together
And my life is on display like Truman
They wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner
My exes made some of my favorite music
I dated women from my favorite movies
Karma's such a thing of beauty
I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it
It's far fetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters
I keep it 100 like I'm running a fever
I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you
If I was you, I wouldn't like me either

And all those nights we snuck out, like to meet up at the bar

But it's hard when you're young
Yeah, it's hard when you're young
Yeah, yeah, it's hard when you're young

Down to my last match fire I touch just to feel
Why is it easier to burn than it is to heal?

Fighting flames with fire
Hang onto burning wires
We don't care anymore
Are we fading lovers?
We keep wasting colors
Maybe we should let this go

We're falling apart, still we hold together
We've passed the end, so we chase forever
'Cause this is all we know
This feeling's all we know

I'll ride my bike up to the road
Down the streets right through the city
I'll go everywhere you go
From Chicago to the coast
You tell me, “Hit this and let's go
Blow the smoke right through the window”
'Cause this is all we know

One bed, different covers
We don't care anymore
Two hearts still beating
On with different rhythms
Maybe we should let this go

Want me to sign there on your range rover heart?

You know you like it but it drives you insane
You know you like it but it drives you insane
You know you like it but you're scared of the shame
What you want, what you gonna do?
You know you like it but it drives you insane
Follow me 'cause you know that you wanna feel the same
You know you like it but it drives you insane
What you want, what you gonna do?"

[Verse 1]
Staring at two different views on your window ledge
Coffee is going cold, it's like time froze
There you go wishing, floating down our wishing well
It's like I'm always causing problems, causing hell
I didn't mean to put you through this, I can tell
We cannot sweep this under the carpet

[Chorus]
I hope that I can turn back the time
To make it all alright, all alright for us
I'll promise to build a new world for us two
With you in the middle
[Break]
(With you in the middle)
(With you in the middle)

[Verse 2]
Lying down beside you, what's going through your head?
The silence in the air felt like my soul froze
Am I just overthinking feelings? I conceal
This gut feeling I'm tryna get off me as well
I hope we find our missing pieces and just chill
We cannot sweep it under the carpet

[Chorus]
I hope that I can turn back the time
To make it all alright, all alright for us
I'll promise to build a new world for us two
With you in the middle

Come on, tell me do you want me
Do you need me like drugs need money
Tell me once more who's your love for?
What's your number when you're sober?

Clearly I'm not thinkin' clearly
When I'm, when I'm, with you, with you
Feels like time is movin' slower

I realize
You never call me when you're sober
You never call me when you're sober

When I'm, when I'm, with you, with you
Feels like time is movin' slower

Now go off, now go off

Smoke stress to get rid of all the stress
On the run, nigga, goin' for the checks
These niggas don't know the half (show time!)

See the hoes, see the clothes, see the cash (goddamn!)
Gettin' high for the low, shit was bad

Swear to God, these niggas don't know the half

Kill 'em off like I got a mask on it
Guillotine a Benz, you don't know the half of it
Whole squad winnin', you got small money
Don't need too many hands, I need all of it
You ain't ever been around, call me 2Pac
Pull up in my old hood in a new drop
On that kush, on that kush, blow a cloud of it
I'm the man, I'm the man, yeah I'm proud of it
Blowin' bands, got 'em jumpin' out the window
Shout out, shout out, pour some more and call it reload
Know I pull up, pull up on 'em like a free throw
Or go straight up, up the middle like I'm D. Rose
Treat your chick just like a whip and get another one
Wanna grab it, push it, smash and get another one
See my dogs on top, that's the math of it
Multiply the money up, no that's just half of it

Dance,Gorillaz,Demon Days ,Fire Coming Out of the Monkey's Head ,"Once upon a time at the foot of a great mountain,
there was a town where the people

known as Happyfolk lived,
their very existence a mystery to the rest of the world
obscured as it was by great clouds. Here they played out their peaceful lives,
innocent of the litany of excess and violence that was growing in the world below.
To live in harmony with the spirit of the mountain called Monkey was enough.
Then one day

Strangefolk arrived in the town.

They came in camouflage,
hidden behind dark glasses

no one noticed them: they only saw shadows.
You see, without the Truth of the Eyes
the Happyfolk were blind.
(Singing)
Falling out of aeroplanes and hiding out in holes
Waiting for the sunset to come, people going home
Jump out from behind them and shoot them in the head
Now everybody's dancing the dance of the dead
The dance of the dead
The dance of the dead.
(Talking)
In time,
the Strangefolk found their way into the higher reaches of the mountain
and it was there that they found the caves
of unimaginable Sincerity and Beauty. By chance,
they stumbled upon the place where all good souls come to rest.
The Strangefolk
they coveted the jewels in these caves above all things,
and soon they began to mine
the mountain,
its rich seam fueling the chaos of their own world.
Meanwhile,
down in the town,
the Happyfolk slept restlessly, their dreams invaded by shadowy figures
digging away at their souls.
Every day, people would wake and stare at the mountain.
Why was it bringing darkness into their lives?
And as the Strangefolk mined deeper
and deeper into the mountain, holes began to appear,
bringing with them a cold and
bitter wind that chilled the very soul of the Monkey.
For the first time, the Happyfolk felt fearful for,
they knew that soon the Monkey would stir from its deep sleep.
Then there came a sound.
Distant first,
it grew into castrophany so immense it could be heard far away in space.
There were no screams.
There was no time.
The mountain called Monkey had spoken.
There was only fire.
And then,
nothing.
(Singing)
Oh, a little town in U.S.A
The time has come to see
There's nothing you believe you are
But where were you when it all came down on me
Did you call me? No"

Bum, your old hit sound dumb, hold it now, crown 'em
Where you found them at got 'em 'round town
Coulda drowned in and it woulda floated bloated
Voted sugar coated loaded hip shooter

Draw for the poor free coffee at the banks
Hit through the straw none more for me, thanks
That blanks the raw that dang sure stank lit
Sank passed the pit for more hardcore prank spit

Crank it on blast, roll past front street
Blew the whole spot like some old ass with skunk meat
These kids is too fast, juiced off a junk treat
Who could get looser off a crunk or a funk beat?

Something is starting today
Where did he go? Why you wanted to be?
Well you know, November has come
When it's gone away

Something is starting today

Well you know, November has come
When it's gone away

Baha can you dig it like a spigot
My guess is yes you can like, can I kick it, wicked
Liquor shot, if you happy and you know it
As you clap your hands to the thick snot of a poet flow it

Broke a pen and I'm in cope hymen
Dope or rhyming all worth it then the hope diamond
Required off the black market or wire tappin'
Couldn't target a jar of spit the rapid fire spark lit

A rapper bug zapper
And it don't matter after if they's a thug or a dapper
Plug yer trap or it's maximum exposure
The beast got family in numbers asking 'em for closure

Aw, send 'em a gun an tell 'em clean it
Then go get the nun who said her son didn't mean it
She wore a filled-in thong, a billabong

They got locks on the gate
Don't go over the edge
You'll make a big mistake

Put me in a cab to suburbia

That seems limitless
With no drop in pressure
Seems like everybody's
Out to test ya

You can't conceal the hate
That consumes you
I'm the reason why you fill up your Isuzu.
Chill with your old lady at the tilt
I got a 90 days extension
And I'm filled with guilt
From things that I've seen
Your water's from a bottle
Mine's from a canteen
At night I hear the shots
Ring so I'm a light sleeper
The cost of life,
It seems to get cheaper
Out in the desert
With my street sweeper
The war is over
So said the speaker
With his flight suit on
Maybe to him I'm just a pawn
So he can advance
Remember when I used to dance

Than me before

O green world, don't deserve me now
I'm made of you and you of me
But where are we? Oh no

Sells to lie from the darkest stars
Suppose you down when you're in fast
'Cause it seems so little to you

But now you're in love, you know
You know, me too, you know, me too

Holy, it feels holy

You don't get nobody, people sigh
It's so bad, lasting far, but love yourself
Hiding in a hole in there

All the glasses are too big bring it back, got to hold it back
To let you do that yet you don't want me back
Before it fall down, falling down, falling down
Falling out to go far from the sun

In these demon days it's so cold inside
So hard for a good soul to survive
You can't even trust the air you breathe
'Cause mother earth wants us all to leave

When lies become reality you numb yourself with drugs and TV
Pick yourself up it's a brand new day so turn yourself round
Don't burn yourself, turn yourself turn yourself around into the sun

In these demon days it's so cold inside
So hard for a good soul to survive
You can't even trust the air you breathe

Don't burn yourself, turn yourself, turn yourself around into the sun

I'm useless but not for long, the future is comin' on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad, I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long, the future is comin' on
Is comin' on, is comin' on, is comin' on
Is comin' on, is comin' on, is comin' on
Is comin' on, is comin' on

Finally someone let me out of my cage
Now, time for me is nothing 'cause I'm counting no age
Now I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs, and I'm under each snare

Intangible, bet you didn't think so I command you to
Panoramic view, look I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose, sit and lose
All you different crews, chicks and dudes
Who you think is really kickin' tunes?

Picture you gettin' down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional
Mystical maybe, spiritual, hearable
Who appears in you is a clearer view 'cause you're too crazy

Lifeless, to know the definition for what life is
Priceless, for you because I put you on the hype shit
You like it? Gun smokin' righteous with one token
Psychic among those, possess you with one go

I ain't happy I'm feeling glad, I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long, the future is comin' on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad, I got sunshine, in a bag
I'm useless but not for long, the future is comin' on
Is comin' on, is comin' on, is comin' on
Is comin' on, is comin' on, is comin' on

The essence the basics, without it you make it
Allow me to make this, child, like in nature
Rhythm, you have it or you don't that's a fallacy
I'm in them, every sprouting tree

Every child apiece, every cloud you see
You see with your eyes, I see destruction and demise
Corruption in disguise, from this fuckin' enterprise
Now I'm sucking to your lies

Through russ, though not his muscles but the percussion he provides
With me as a guide, you all can see me now
'Cause you don't see with your eye, you perceive with your mind
That's the inner, so I'm gonna stick around with russ and be a mentor

With a few rhymes so mother fuckers, remember where the thought is
I brought all this, so you can survive when law is lawless
Feelings, sensations that you thought were dead
No squealing remember, that it's all in your head

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad, I got sunshine, in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long, the future is comin' on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad, I got sunshine, in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long, my future is comin' on
Is comin' on, is comin' on, is comin' on
Is comin' on, is comin' on
My future is comin' on
Is comin' on, is comin' on, is comin' on
Is comin' on, is comin' on
My future is comin' on
Is comin' on, is comin' on, is comin' on
Is comin' on, is comin' on
My future is comin' on
Is comin' on, is comin' on, is comin' on
My future is comin' on
Is comin' on, is comin' on
My future is comin' on
Is comin' on, is comin' on

Is my mandate
I'm highly animated even though I'm decomposing
So if your feet is frozen I'm a die to see you ropin'

Come on shake and bake do whatever it takes

Gravitational pull
I'll have you making a fool
Out of yourself on the dance floor
Doing back spins, running man, and more
Party down with Vigga and Candor
Coming to the jam
Or look like a landlubber
And do the aqua boogie
Win lots of goodies maybe
Pop a Gucci wallet turntables is talking to me
It's awfully groovy
Seeing all the treasure and the booty

I wanna get down lower than Atlantis
Going toe to toe with an enchantress
Get funkier than funkadelic wearin' pampers
While you eggheads is on the wall preparin' answers
Sharing transcripts while we over here
Dipping and dancin'
Rhythm romancin'
Wallflowers
Giving no act you no
All hours we chillin' and maxin', so
Relaxing
Opposites attracting
I'm a toss my hat in
Floss when the track spin
Like I'm on a crack binge
Jigging and wiggling
Freakin' booties speakin' to the cuties so belligerent
No religion just bump the feed on
You'll feel reborn
Negativity we just dead it like dcon
Better lift your feet and just measure the beat on
The pulse when it respawns

Tap your toes and clap your hands
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on trace the globe and shake your pants

Just twist your hip and do the dip

J-dub to the boom now make it

Bounce-wiggle, bounce-wiggle
Shakin' all them bangs out
Chemical cut throats
Bound to blow the brain out

Cut to the brain, this ain't no game
I'll show no shame, I'll birth this blame
I'm twisted Cain, I'll twist again
I'll push the blade as plain as day

Known to what these sayers say
Known to what these doers do
We shoot where who and you-know-where
We's about to take it there

We's about to make it clear
We happy or we lonesome
The long jump, the beat heart
From start to finish

Ten spoons of spinach
The soul and the spillage
The cup that runneth over
Return of the 'O God'

All alone, all alone
All alone, all alone
All alone, all alone
All alone, all alone

All alone, all alone
All alone, all alone
All alone, all alone
All alone, all alone

Close your eyes and see
When there ain't no light
All you'll ever be
Come on save the night

Because I don't believe
When the morning comes
It doesn't seem to say
An awful lot to me

All alone, all alone
All alone, all alone
All alone, all alone
All alone, all alone

All alone, all alone
All alone, all alone
All alone, all alone
All alone, all alone"
Dance,Flume,Skin ,Numb & Getting Colder (feat. Kučka) ,"Make your decisions now
Weight it up
Facing a long road down
Keeping your head above
Saying the same thing twice, won't make it right
Head up in your desires, whoah

Maybe we're looking for different way
Does it matter when you act like this
Yeah, you got into something
Now you took control of you, oh
Cause you say it, but you won't admit it, oh
Numb and getting colder, physical existence
Say something

Said you begged to leave
I won't be behind you
And I can't breathe, breathe
I won't be behind you

Said you begged to leave
I won't be behind you
And I can't breathe, breathe
I won't be behind you

Not gonna tell you stop, ease it up
Hold your emotions back, stop taking it out on her
I'm gonna lose no pride, giving up
We're going on lockdown

But maybe you're looking for a different way
Does it matter when you act like this
Yeah, you got into something
Now you took control of you, oh
Cause you say it, but you won't admit it, oh
Numb and getting colder, physical existence
Say something

Said you begged to leave
I won't be behind you
And I can't breathe, breathe
I won't be behind you

Said you begged to leave
I won't be behind you
And I can't breathe, breathe
I won't be behind you

If I feel like losing my mind
We're into deep
But feelings often we leave behind
I'm too weak from this
And trust your instincts
Broken, don't do one thing, survive
So primitively

Said you begged to leave
I won't be behind you
And I can't breathe, breathe
I won't be behind you

Said you begged to leave
I won't be behind you
And I can't breathe, breathe
I won't be behind you"

[Verse 1]
Put away your inhibitions
Let the beast in you just get loose
We all young, wild and different
We could all get lit from a lil goose
I know you’re terrified by what the future lies
But there’s no compromising, it’s my way or the highway
We all just played the lust, hard building breaking trust
She gon’ get wowed when we come out
Like she gon’ get loud when the weed come out this instant
Give a fuck what your friends think
Tell they bougie ass go wait in line
With them lame niggas talking real rap
Tell ‘em break your neck go and bust a rhyme

Blow one down, pass it around
Fuck with me now, we’re running wild
Nobody game, we own the town
Never come down, I’ll never come down

Lose it
I might lose it
Lose it
I might lose it

[Verse 2]
Everybody got guilty pleasures
Mine just tend to catch me cases
Handcuffs, police inspections
Lawyers, judges, allegations
Turn on your favorite station
You hear the same old song
I feel like Nagasaki, dog
I’m ‘bout to drop the bomb

[Pre-Chorus]
Blow one down, pass it around
Fuck with me now, we’re running wild
And nobody game, we own the town
Never come down, I’ll never come down
Blow one down, pass it around
Fuck with me now, we’re running wild
And nobody game, we own the town
Never come down, I’ll never come down

You ain't got no money, I ain't got no time
All these faces lookin' funny when I'm drivin' by
Had to tint my whip, my name is buzzin'
Know they plan on killin' mine
Aimin' at your temple, we was taught to kill a nigga mind
Genocide buried in the tide, cleanse it in the sand
Blood is sittin' in my hands, I'll never be the bigger man
I know they'll never understand, but I don't give a fuck
Lift your hands up high before I stick you up

[Chorus: KUČKA]
I held you to the ground cause you were floating
Told me you're afraid of disappointing
Pushing on your physical existence
Pushing only cause you felt resistance
Can't help but think about the situation
Tryna get to see but my mind's racing
Only got each other we can turn to
Lying here, I know they'll never break you free

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
You and me nobody else
If it can't be that way then I'll just be all by myself
I love the way you stay away from me, you make me melt
Those nights you used to come and stay with me
Replaying in my memory, it's no such thing as meant to be
That's fine cause you so fine, the way you walk, you talk
The way you leave your mark, just can't break you from my thoughts
Walkin' through Ramona Park like they wasn't tryna shoot me up
Doing all we did, we still ain't do enough

[Chorus: KUČKA]
Leaving through the night and starting fires
Going through society's desires
Smoke and retribution, keep it burning
Only cause of sorrow I'll be learning
Can't help but think about the situation
Tryna get to see but my mind's racing
Only got each other we can turn to
Lying here, I know they'll never break you free

[Verse 3: Vince Staples]
Nah, I ain't scared of six feet
Cause I ain't scared to be free
All I seen while on this earth
Know that hearse can't be too worse
Tell the woman that I hurt
That I apologize for all my lies
And tell my mama blame my karma
Hate she had to see me die
I just wanna see the sky
Shinin' from the other side
Lookin' down on all my friends
Makin' sure they're walkin' right
Cause ain't nobody watch our back
And this life way too hard for that
I made it out with my heart intact
Might harm me, still can't harvest that

Sometimes it feels like
The world spin opposite of the way you spin
Sometimes you just gotta create your own
A world

[Hook: Allan Kingdom]
I been on a mission, man
I been on a mission lately
Some sticky situations I just grinder down to make it
I’ve never been to prison, man
Still don’t know what it is to break free, no, no
Now I live my vision plan, no need to hallucinate
The nigga be slipping, man, I think they gon’ make me angry
If they would’ve listened I could’a kept my cool today
Evil got me tripping, man, I don’t think that you can say, no, no
You’re in my position, man, you just couldn’t hit the brakes

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
I can’t believe it
Word on the street’s one of my soldiers talking to them alphabet boys
My first reaction is to find out who, where and why
Put the word out and bring ‘em to me now, but keep ‘em alive
Put some bread on his head and make sure he’ll rot
Cause this is something I ain’t tolerating
Plus I’m getting impatient
I’m fainting o’ breaking for real, but I’m salivating
My phone rung it’s at the seven o’clock sharp
They said they had ‘em in one o’ my warehouses by the dock
Jumped in the Benz with a ill look, no grin
With a still hook, I’ma ‘bout to do this coward in
When I got there DD was already tied up
Pillow case on his head and the blood stains dried up
The moment I been waiting for is finally here
I get to see who done betrayed me
Snatched the pillow case off this wigger
Hold him here and now he's tryna' face me
Who I see, my little niece boyfriend I seen
He begging me not to kill him
I told ‘em I got him
As I poured the gasoline, I thought about my little niece
I know she love him, but he a snail
He tryna push love in jail
Take me from my wife and kids
Why should I spare this maggot life and limb
Man, it is what it is
He chose to play this game
I lit the match and watched his frame go up in flames

[Refrain: Allan Kingdom]
Get emotion
We in motion
Make commotion
I can feel
How we roll on
Keep it going
Let it go out
Take the wheel
Saw up in your eyes
I'm amazed, I know
Saw up in your eyes
To the things I know
We rode it for life
Put the game on me
If we don't get it right
Put the blame on me

[Verse 2: Allan Kingdom]
Guess again
Thought that you could pull the word over a veteran
I would pull the trigger but I'm thinking that it's better I, better I
Burn you like a cinder, let me share the light, share the light
(Yeah)
Gasoline
Pour it in my tank
Now it's absorbing in your skin
Man, this fool is dimmer and I wish she had a better mind, better mind
Where you talking now you were regretting mind, get it right
I been cutting loose ends
Why your lips so loose talking
I could fuck with new friends too
Gotta get it with my new
I could be a nuisance
But not if you use caution
???
It’s time we write some new commandments

When they never seem to forget
So admit it. More than you said
Grill it down inside of your head

[Chorus: Beck]
Oh, she is following me in my head, but I am all alone
Thinking of her every time I want to try to let her go
But it's never easy when you think you have it in control
Somehow you get caught up in the moment and you never know
All these tiny cities that you're holding in your little hand
In the wind like diamond lights, they'll blow away in desert sand

It was never perfect, it was never meant to last

[Verse 1:]
Thought that I’d be better off if I were on my own
I tried to put my finger on the moment we were wronged
But the taste turned bitter, so I pulled the trigger
Not so easy to move on, I guess I should have known

[Chorus:]
Ice cold I freeze up when I see ya
Left you just to find out that I need ya
So far I want to pull you closer
I wish we could start the whole thing over

[Hook:]
Ever since I left you, I’ve been trying to get you back
And it keeps getting worse
I’m burning on the inside and the truth is that I, didn’t know how good you were
Until you were gone (x2)

[Verse 2:]
I was always told that only time would heal the pain
Yet even though it’s been so long it still hurts just the same
Yet now I’m finding, that the break was binding
Let’s take back everything I said oh won't you just come home

[Chorus]

Freely feeling everything
You had me reeling
All along the bottom of the deep sea
Can I shake this feeling?
Can I shake this feeling?

Tonight, light a fire
We'll be flying up and higher
Burning bright, taking flight
As we leave all our worries behind
It is something special you have
If you didn't know, but now just

[Verse 1]
I got something to say
A confession of me
I've been led astray
Tried so hard to change
But I'm set on my ways
My words mean nothing again

[Chorus]
I promised I'd be good
But I can't help myself from these temptations
When they come, there's nothing I can do
I promised I'd be good
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
So when I fall, I will fall to you

[Post-Chorus]
I promised I'd be good
I promised I'd be good

[Verse 2]
I just couldn't resist
It was the moment of bliss
I know it's hard to forgive
It's too late for changes
All this time I've wasted
Words mean nothing, nothing again

I missed you so much, I missed you so much

Tell me, is this freedom, baby?
Chasing after danger, making my heart race, woah

Maybe on the dark side we can be together, be together
Maybe in a million miles, on a highway through the skies
Someday soon, we'll be together

Do you recall, not long ago
We would walk on the sidewalk
Innocent, remember?
All we did was care for each other

But the night was warm
We were bold and young
All around the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go

[Chorus x2:]
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on

What will we do when we get old?
Will we walk down the same road?
Will you be there by my side?
Standing strong as the waves roll over

When the nights are long
Longing for you to come home
All around the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go

[Chorus x2:]
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on

All we need is somebody to lean on
All we need is somebody to lean on
Lean on, lean on, lean on, lean on...

Oh my my my, what you do to me
Like lighting when I'm swimming in the sea

From the very first time we touched
Walking on wires and power lines
You put your body on top of mine
Every time that you lift me up
To the heavens and stars above

Oh lord have mercy
I'm begging you, please
I'm feeling drained
I need love
You charge me up
Like electricity
Jumpstart my heart
With your love

There's an energy
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful
I can feel it
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful

[Ellie Goulding:]
I couldn't leave even if I wanted to
Cause something keeps pulling me back to you
From the very first time we loved
From the very first time we touched
The stroke of your fingers
The scent of your lingers
My mind roaming wild
The thoughts of your smile
Oh, you gotta give me some
Or you can give it all
But it’s never enough no

Hold me in your arms
Burns like a fire
Electricity
When you’re close I feel the sparks
Takes me higher to infinity "

Yo no funciono sin ella
El recuerdo me atropella
Se robo mi corazón
Hay que hacer una querella
Trato de borrar tu huella
Con un cigarro y una botella
Tu eres la baby que me lleva a las estrellas
Mi flan de coco
Me pone [?]
Me pongo nervioso de solo pensar que te toco
Iba guiándome ella
Más casi por poco choco
A mí tú no me engañas
Tú eres loca con el loco
Tú quieres que me humille
Tú quieres que me arrodille
Pero cuidado con el guille
Porque a la que te pille
Con besos mojados
Sabe que te maravilles
Como y está tranquilo
Hasta que en el Ferrari te pille

Ahora una botella
Es lo que ahoga el amor por ella
La estoy buscando ya quiero verla
Estoy perdido y no se que hacer
Y me ha dejado una huella
Me paso hablándole a las estrellas
Ay que le digan que yo sin ella
Creo que voy a enloquecer

Quisiera saber
Que hay de una vez
Porque de mí ella se fue
Sí un día la ven, preguntenle
Si conmigo quiere volver

No le gusta el bochinche

Yo no me llevo de lo que la gente dice

Tú me enamoras, gyal
Todo tiene sentido cuando estamos juntos
Tú me enamoras, gyal
Cuando el DJ pone la music y bailas así
Ahí me enamoro más
Mirando el sol de la mañana y tú juntito a mí
Tú me enamoras, gyal

Viajando el mundo y tu sonrisa
Tengo en mi mente y en mi corazón
Contigo todo es felicidad
Contigo ya no sé lo que es dolor
Cuando me empiezas a besar
No soy el mismo y pierdo el control

Ven, dime qué tú tienes, que enamoras
La forma de tu cuerpo y cuando me hablas
Más lindos son los sueños cuando tú estás
Gyal, esto no puede terminar

Ven, dime qué tú tienes, que enamoras

Tú me enamoras, gyal

Tú me tienes bien loco, mamita, si te toco
Cuando veo tú foto yo siempre me alboroto
Tu teléfono exploto cuando quiero un poco
Me haces sentir como ganarme la loto

Nos vamos en mi carro
Nos vamos en mi moto
En esa boca con un beso te azoto

Ven, dime qué tú tienes, que enamoras
La forma de tu cuerpo y cuando me hablas
Más lindos son los sueños cuando tú estás
Gyal, esto no puede terminar

Latin,Nicky Jam,Fénix ,I Can't Forget You ,"I know we're no longer together
And you moved on with another
Not a day goes by that I don't miss your face
You can be warm under the covers
We make love and like no other
I regret not doing more than make you stay

So if the world is getting heavy
And you feel the need to call me
Never doubt it, I'll always be right here
If I had a chance to bring you back to me
I would do it in a heartbeat
Never doubt it, I'll always be right here

As much as I pretend
I can't forget the day you left
You're the air I breathe
My life was in your kiss
My breath in your lips
So how do I live?
If baby you're the air I breathe
(Cause baby you're the air I breathe)

Oye mami
We can't help without feeling you owe me
Holding the pillow I'm pretending is your body
Is like I'm drowning underwater with my insights
This the kind of pain that makes a man cry
Holding it and keeping it cool
So I be steady on my rack I keep my mind over you
But it ain't working
I'm missing you like a drug
Is like I can't get back the air of my lungs
That's why I'm telling

Lady
No matter how far
Wherever you are
I'm waiting for you
I don't wanna, I don't wanna let go
[x2]

As much as I pretend
I can't forget the day you left you the air I breathe
My life was in your kiss
My breath in your lips
So how do I live?
If baby you're the air I breathe
(Cause baby you're the air I breathe)

So if the world is getting heavy
And you feel the need to call me
Never doubt it, I'll always be right here
If I had a chance to bring you back to me
I would do it in a heartbeat
Never doubt it, I'll always be right here

As much as I pretend
I can't forget the day you left you the air I breathe
My life was in your kiss
My breath in your lips
So how do I live?

Latin,Nicky Jam,Fénix ,Without You ,"Hey, hey
IPhone with no wi-fi
A cloud without the skies
A christmas tree without the lights
I would never be alright without you

It's like the beat without the drum
A power cord without the plug, oh
A lottery ticket with no luck
I can never be the one without you

Now were one without the doctor
Halloween without the monsters, oh
Nothing even seems okay
I will never be the same without you

A guitar with no strings
Or a singer who can't sing
I'm like a bird without its wings
I can't even do a thing, without you

Cinematic masterpiece
A king without his queen
So call it Adam without Eve
Baby I'm just incomplete, without you

Now the one without the doctor
Halloween without the monsters, oh
Nothing even seems okay
I will never be the same without you

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh

In a suit with no gravity
I'm losing touch of my reality
A bird who doesn't know it's cage
No compass to escape
I'm lost without you, so

Wo-oh-oh-oh
Wo-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh

Now were one without the doctor
Halloween without the monsters, oh
Nothing even seems okay
I will never be the same without you

Like a flower with no sun
Like the kiss without no fun
Like the beat without the drum
I will never know a love, without you, ay "

Dime si es verdad...
Me dijeron que te estas casando
Tú no sabes lo que estoy sufriendo
Esto te lo tengo que decir

Cuéntame
Tu despedida para mi fue dura
Será que te llevo a la luna
Y yo no supe hacerlo así

Te estaba buscando
Por las calles gritando
Eso me está matando oh no

Te estaba buscando
Por las calles gritando
Como un loco tomando oh...

Es que yo sin ti
Y tú sin mi
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Esto no me gusta
Esto no me gusta

Es que yo sin ti
Y tú sin mi
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Eso no me gusta
Eso no me gusta

Vivir si ti, no aguanto más
Por eso vengo a decirte lo que siento
Estoy sufriendo en esta soledad

Y aunque tu padre no aprobó esta relación
Yo sigo insistiendo a pedir perdón
Lo único que importa está en tu corazón

Te estaba buscando
Por las calles gritando
Esto me está matando oh no

Te estaba buscando
Por las calles gritando
Como un loco tomando oh...

Es que yo sin ti
Y tú sin mi
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Esto no me gusta
Esto no me gusta

Es que yo sin ti
Y tú sin mi
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Eso no me gusta
Eso no me gusta

Yo te juré a ti eterno amor
Y ahora otro te da calor
Cuando en las noches tienes frío oh oh

Yo sé que él te parece mejor
Pero yo estoy en tu corazón
Y por eso pido perdón

Es que yo sin ti
Y tú sin mi
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Esto no me gusta oh no

Es que yo sin ti
Y tú sin mi
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Esto no me gusta oh yeah...

(Tú sin mí)
Dicen que uno no sabe lo que tiene
Hasta que lo pierde pero...
(Yo sin ti)
Vale la pena luchar por lo que uno quiere

Y hacer el intento

Era tiempo de que te olvidara, te olvidara
Aveces pienso que esto no se acaba
Parece que el tiempo no pasara, no pasara

Al ver mis ojos recordaste que sentías
Tu piel no olvida lo que sientes todavía
Y me aceptaste que eras a mi a quien preferías
Y que extrañaste mi calor la noche fría

Te tentaste con otros hombres lo se
Y busque otros amres tambien
Pero no te olvido, pero no te olvido
Aunque el tiempo pase esto sigue vivo

Esta relación
Fue una situacioón
Del amor que nos puso en el camino

Por mi parte
Nada tengo
Que decir
Porque nunca
Nunca tuve nada que sentir
Por ti

Solo atracción
Que duró hasta que abriste la boca
Y seguí contigo por curiosidad
Esa es la verdad

Adiós
Me despides de tu cuerpo
Dile que no fue lo máximo
Que no voy a recordar nada en particular

Adiós, me despides de tu tiempo
Aburrido
Adiós, me despides de los tuyos
Por los míos

Latin,Banda Sinaloense MS de Sergio Lizarraga,La Mejor Versión De Mí ,Tu Postura ,"Me da mucha tristeza ver como eres
No es que lo exagere
Nada te reprocho
Nada te pregunto
Solo si me quieres

Yo se que hablando esto se arreglaría
Más te mentiría
Si te digo algo
Como por ejemplo
Que no pasa nada

Parece, es nada más cuando tú quieres
Cuando tienes ganas
Me duele que no te importa si se muere
Este corazón
Que a pesar de todo
Todavía te ama

Me están sobrando los motivos para irme
Y lo que más me da coraje es tu postura
Parece que estás obligándome a rendirme
Para al final decir que yo tuve la culpa

Y si no cambias desde horita te lo advierto
Voy a empezar igual que tú conmigo
Y no es venganza ni rencor ni mucho menos
Es simplemente dar lo mismo que recibo

Haces mucho más difícil lo que tiene arreglo
Parece que hacerme llorar te alimenta el ego

Con ver tus ojos lindos llenos de ternura
Y sin pensar ya estaba hablándote de amor
Que hasta cortito me quedaba Nerdua
En el momento me arriesgué
Yo no sabía lo que irías a pensar de mi
Besé tus labios y esperé a que reaccionaras
Y una sonrisa se te dibujó en la cara

Ni yo mismo me la creo en lo que te convertirías
Simplemente en lo más importante de mis días
Ya habiía decidido no creer en el amor
Demasiado tarde tu sonrisa doblegó mi corazón

Ni yo mismo me la creo pero me lo dicen tus ojos
La manera en que me miran, sienten lo que estoy sintiendo
Bien dicen, lo mejor llegan cuando no lo esperas
Tú te adueñaste en un ratito de toda mi vida entera

Que puede pasar un siglo y mil amores
Y a pesar de mis errores
Sé que un día tú me vas a perdonar
Y yo acepto la culpa
Sé que poco hombre fui
Pero entiende que no soy nadie sin ti
Ya no soy el niño que jugaba

Por más que te creías nadie muere por amor
Me cansé, no pierdo mi tiempo
No soy aquel ingenuo que en tus labios se perdió

Tiras la piedra, escondes la mano
Siempre te haces la víctima
Te quité la máscara del engaño
Márchate y no vuelvas más

Porque no soy aquel idiota que moría por tocar tu piel
Porque amarte fue cosa de ayer
No vuelvo en tu juego a caer

Tú que te creías que nadie remplazaría
Ese amor barato que al final fue porquería
Porque no soy aquel idiota, no te quiero

Ya sé que duele por dentro
Saber que no me importa si te mueres de rencor
Se ve, se nota de lejos
Que anhelas atraparme pero ya esto terminó

Tiras la piedra, escondes la mano
Siempre te haces la víctima
Te quité la máscara del engaño
Márchate y no vuelvas más

Porque no soy aquel idiota que moría por tocar tu piel
Porque amarte fue cosa de ayer
No vuelvo en tu juego a caer

Tú que te creías que nadie remplazaría
Ese amor barato que al final fue porquería
Porque no soy aquel idiota, no te quiero

Sometimes you have to cry
You know how to smile yet
You know that

Yo, Dice

Porque no soy aquel idiota que moría por tocar tu piel
Porque amarte fue cosa de ayer
No vuelvo en tu juego a caer

Si cada noche solo pienso
En ese beso y ese adiós
Cómo vivir sin tu calor

Cada día guardo tu olor
Aunque el culpable siempre fui yo
Y ahora me quedo con temor
Cómo vivir sin tu perdón

Y cada minuto que pasa
Poco a poco me mata y llego a depresión
Sueño con volver a tu cama
Sigo con la esperanza de obtener tu amor
Te dedico esta canción con dolor

Por favor, corazón, no me dejes solo
Porque yo te necesito, te necesito
Mi vida sin ti yo no la he podido vivir
Te necesito, te necesito

Por favor, corazón, no me dejes solo

Es todo lo que anhelo
Tu imagen sigue en mi pecho

Sueño con volver a tu cama
Sigo con la esperanza de obtener tu amor

Una es fuego en la cama
La otra complementa mi alma

[Intro: Romeo Santos]
Envy is a sign of admiration
Hate: It’s the epitome of destruction

[Verse 1: Romeo Santos]
Tal parece que mi amor crece y crece
Pero tú desvaneces y me ofreces tu amistad
Sin otra excepción
Se que hay otro hombre
Que ha logrado lo que y jamás a ti te di
Un hogar, una familia, un buen porvenir
Perdón por hacerte daño

[Hook: Romeo Santos]
Y por ti, vivo aniquilado en el despecho
Reprimido, ardiendo por los celos
Lo odio, aunque él te haga feliz
A mi nada me intimida, pero entiendo
Que él gano la guerra hace tiempo
Y se me olvida que ya te perdí

[Bridge: Drake]
Celo sus besos, sobre tu cuerpo
La envidia se apodera así de mí
(Y te quiero aquí)
Odio ese hombre, porque está a tu lado
Perdí tu amor, soy un pobre diablo
Sin tu amor yo no soy nada

[Hook]

[Interlude: Romeo Santos]
Escucha las palabras
Yo fui el llanto
Él es tu sonrisa
Y lo nuestro desplomó sobre un volcán
Muy de prisa

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, you were the one
You've been the one from the moment I seen you
Sometimes I question if this is all real
Then I grab on that ass and I firmly believe it
And you look like you drawn by an artist
No you - you look like Bernice and Yaris
But both put together, those are some girls that I know from back home
If you saw 'em you'd get it
Look don’t worry about it, keep speakin' Spanish
I’ll get it translated, you know you my baby
Anything for you, anything baby
I do not wanna be enemies baby
I would just much rather give you a baby
And buy you a house, so I live with you baby
Don't stay with this new guy, I really go crazy
I really go crazy

Sin voto a elegir su preferencia sexual

Ay amalo
Quiérelo
Acéptalo
Consiéntelo
En fin es un regalo de dios

Ay
A defiéndelo
Añóralo
Protégelo
Adóralo
Que no somos para otro juzgar

Don’t be a fool
This is not a gay record
This is a reality song
Ignorance ain’t taking us nowhere
Copy!?

Aproximadamente
Más de 30 personas de gays
Se quitan la vida anual

Quizás 1% de ellos
Son mis fanáticos
De todos modos a mí me importa
Keep your head up
Stop the hate "

[Romeo]
Dejaste en mi cama tu aroma y sudor
No olvido el dia que perdimos el pudor

Quiero que hagamos el amor como animales
Similar a aquella noche cuando fuimos indomables
Agresivo y salvaje
Enfermitos incurables

Yo no te dije ni una frase de amor
Y no digo que sea ilogico
Pero esa noche tu cuerpo pidio calor
Sin romance nada biblico
No te lleve serenata a tu ventanda
Ni escribi mil poesias en bachata
Solo te vi, me mirastes asi
Nos hicimos sentir un ratito feliz

Quiero que hagamos el amor como animales
Similar a aquella noche cuando fuimos indomables
Agresivo y salvaje
Enfermitos incurables

It's me yo, the CEO
Dame beso, yo necesito

Fly me out where is warm, hace frío
And you can hit it like José Canseco
Yeah, and I'ma give you this hit caliente
But Ima need a big sweet Presidente
Baby if you like it rough
Give it to me toda la noche
Por favor baby rip me right out of my Dolce

Baby, como Animales

Ven a mi
No arruinemos el momento

De un rey que los ama
Que se ha entregado en cuerpo y alma en cada canción
Se que ha mi funeral probablemente llegaran mis enemigos
Pero los perdono
Al árbol que da fruto es que le tiran mas

Y perdono si una novia me fue infiel y me ha engañado
A los que extendí una mano y por esquinas me fallaron
Hasta que se disfrazo de gran amigo tan sincero
A mi hermano traicionero que se vende por dinero
Y a todos los romeistas
Los amo los amo los amo

Hay chichi

Y en invierno que se suene una bachatica del mayimbe
Y que derramen un chin de coñac
Yes sir

A mi hijo pido excusas si una vez yo le falle
No olvide que un hombre es hombre si respeta a la mujer
Mi hermanita y madresita saben que yo no he mentido
No soy gay pero la envidia se dedica a desmentirlo
Y a todos los romeistas
Los amo los amo los amo

El envidioso inventa el rumor
El chismoso lo difunde
Y el idiota se lo cree

Mi reputación ha sido producto de ese veneno
Yo no soy perfecto pero en mi closet no hay secretos
Quizá no diré sin tener un gramy me vale mier..
Aparentemente no me soporta ni la academia

Y si yo muero
Si mañana muero

Que diosito me condene o perdone mis pecados
Y si un poco arrogante lo que tengo lo he sudado
Mucha gente me pregunta si regresa aventura
Y yo siempre soy el malo sin causar esa ruptura
Y a todos los romeistas
Los amo los amo los amo

Mañana si yo muero no me lloren pues se quedan lo recuerdos

Between the shows and the tours
I’m barely home anymore

Lady
You gotta trust that I’m yours
I’d give it all up and more
And I'ma tell you again
If you didn’t know before

Tú llora-llora-lloras
Tantas madrugadas
Te he dicho que te amo
Y no crees en mis palabras
Tu vicio miento
Tu instinto falla
Soy un hombre nuevo
No temas de nada

Tú llora-llora-lloras...
Tú dudas de mí
Quizás por mi pasado (ya no soy así)
Lo mejor de mi pasado
Fue conocerte a ti

Baby
The number you used to find
The panties in the truck I would hide

Y un chupón en el cuello
Con excusas baratas
That is all in my past

I was shady
That’s who I used to be
But, baby, that’s not me
Not anymore
Let me tell you again
If you didn’t know before

Que se sienta orgulloso
De encontrar amor
Que agarre a su pareja
Y sin pena griten (woooo)

And all my ladies
That made playas fall in love
And took control (control)
The ones who use to cry
But don’t cry anymore
Scream (woooo)

Pero no la culpo

No estaríamos juntos
Hablando claro
Sin pelos en la lengua
Estoy pidiendo pa’ parar esta guerra
Dile, dile, dile

Tu instinto de mujer
Was on point before (right on)
But right now, mami
You’re way off

After every show (el negro)
Como Sylvester Stallone
Oye loco, tú get home
Me invideras tú y mi nene
Ya no estoy pa' party (no estoy pa’ party)

Solo me detiene

Se acaban y no las pruebo

Que quiere cama niña
Hacer que pida mi cariño
De tu cuerpo me hago dueño
Así lo veo en mis sueños

Por fa no me niegues tu cariño
De tu cuerpo me hago dueño
Pero es el mío y yo soy tu sueño

Tú y yo tenemos intercambio de personalidades
Y nos manifestamos con hechos reales
Tú me tocas y yo te toco
Te vuelves loca, también me vuelvo loco

Y tú, eres un éxtasis
Lo hace muy bien con énfasis
Te concentras, yo me concentro
Ábreme el espacio mientras yo entro

Entrando en tus sueños, congelo el momento
Me robo las llaves de tu corazón
Baby quien diría que desde ese día
Comenzó la historia en esa habitación

Dime cositas al oído que me exciten para así entrar en calor

Ay tú cuerpo es esa musa que desearía tener cualquier pintor
Una noche no será suficiente

Somos Beyonce y Jay-Z
Mucho glamour y mucho Blin
Salimos a la calle y todos logran percibir
Tu elegancia y la forma en que tu me abrazas
Tú estas dura baby, tu medida es de mi talla

Somos dos locos enamorados contra el mundo... (Tú y yo),
Así tus padres no me quieran, yo voy por ti hasta el fin, baby,
Ya no quiero mentiras para ir a buscarte,
Estoy cansado de escondites pa’ poder tenerte,
Cuando será ese día que acepten tus padres,
Que el corazón no elige cuando enamorarse...

[Cosculluela:]
Ya estoy harto de mentir y decir las cosas como no son,
De nuestra relación solamente saben una versión,
Es que en televisión me pintan un hombre sin corazón,
Pero tú me conoces, sabes que camino en dirección,
Sólo pa’ arriba, [?] con iniciativa,
Y nada va a pasarte a ti mientras yo viva,
Dile al viejo que tu estas con el que nadie derriba,
Y que ni se preocupe mientras yo escriba, y las cante,
Un amor allá me levante, yo por ti meto las manos al horno sin guantes,
Múdense de mi pasado, vivan el durante,
Yo juré de mi vida dedicarte el restante... El Princi!

[Maluma:]
Se pasan los días... Yo buscándote, tú extrañándome, nos queremos ver,
En el mismo lugar donde sin miedos fuimos cómplices de nuestro placer.

No puedo con esta demora,
Discúlpeme señora, del libro de mi vida su hija es la autora,
Ella no me ve, solo me escucha en la emisora,
Y de un botón la señal se evapora,
Y otro programa, es otro día, otra mañana,
Nos comunicamos aunque sea por telegrama,
Estoy grave, con esto de hablar en clave,
Si este amor es ilegal, que me boten la llave,
Que nada se acabe, que todo siga de intriga, 
Aunque tu viejo nos persiga, que dios lo bendiga y no le quite lo que nos una,
Es un amor para siempre, díselos Maluma... c´mon!

Anoche fue solo una aventura
Y yo no quería decirte adiós
Entre sabanas blancas tu y yo hicimos el amor
Y hoy saber que ya no te tengo
Let’s do it

Y pensar que ya tienes dueño
Pero yo contigo sueño ma
Y que hacer con esta locura
Sigo sufriendo, si no te tengo
Y pensar que ya tienes dueño
Pero yo contigo sueño ma
Y que hacer con esta locura
Sigo sufriendo, si no te tengo (o no)

Es duro de aceptarlo pero es así ya no estas
Las veinte y cuatro horas yo no paro de pensar
Lo que pudo pasar porque tuvo que terminar
Si yo fuera tan real

Ma loco tu me tiene
Porque tu no viene
No se porque diablos te detienes
Si tu sabes que yo soy tu nene
El que a tí te enciende

Dame una noche pa que vea
Pa que me compare con el y tu misma crea
Que nadie como yo a tí te desea
Por tí hago lo que sea (repito)
Como yo nadie te desea
Y por ti hago lo que sea (oh yeah)

Tu piel con mi piel
Combinan tan bien
Que no hay margen de error
(La combinación pecta tu y yo)
Hacer el amor, sin miedo a caer
Mas en la tentación

Y pensar que ya tienes dueño
Pero yo contigo sueño ma
Y que hacer con esta locura
Sigo sufriendo, si no te tengo
Y pensar que ya tienes dueño
Pero yo contigo sueño mas
Y que hacer con esta locura
Sigo sufriendo, si no te tengo
(Prety Boy, Dirty Boy)

Escucha mamasita o bien vengo a decir que yo
Muero por repetir lo que vivimos esa noche amor
Muero por decirte tantas cosas
Bebita me muero por ser dueña de tu boca
Y talvez que fluya nuestro amor
Después que los dos dijimos que sería un error
Detrás de una pasión casi no hay sentimiento
Pero quiero navegar hasta anclar en tu cuerpo
Hazme caso mujer ve
Cuando volveré a tenerte
En verdad se me hace un deseo insaciable
Cuento las horas pa no vivir de un recuerdo
No lo neguemos tu naciste pa mi

Mamasita no te niegues al amor
Dame una oportunidad
No quiero vivir de recuerdos

Son la cinco de manana
Y no he dormido nada
Pensando en tu belleza
Loco voy a parar
El insomnio es mi castigo
Tu amor sera mi alivio
Y hasta que no seas mia no
Vivire en paz

Hoy conoci tu novio
Pequeno y no hermoso
Se que el no te quire
Por su forma de hablar

Ademas tu no lo amas
Porque el no da la talla
No sabe complacerte
Como lo hario yo
Pero tendre panciencia
Porque el no es competencia
Por eso no hay motivos
Para yo respetar

Refrain:
No,no es amor lo que tu sientes
Se llama obsesion
Una ilusion
En tu pensamiento
Que te hace hacer cosas
Asi funciona el corazon

Verse 2:
Bien vestido en mi lexus
Pase por tu colegio
Me informan que te fuistes
Como loco fui alcanzar
Te busque y no te encontraba
Y eso me procubada
Para calmar mi ansia
Yo lo queria llamar
Pero no tenia tu numero
Y tu amiga ya me lo nego
Esta bonita mucho me
Ayudo y eso
Me trajo la solucion
Yo se que le gustaba
Y que le di una mirada
Con un par de la palabritas
Yu numero me dio
Del celular llamaba
Y tu no contestabas
Luego te puse un beeper
Y no habia conexion
Mi unica esperanza
Es que oigas mis palabras
No puedo, tengo novio
No me enganches por favor

No,no es amor lo que tu sientes
Se llama obsesion

Verse 3:
Hice cita pal siquiarta
A ver si me ayudaba
Pues ya no tengo amigos
Por solo hablar de ti
Lo que quiero es hablarte
Para intentar besarte
Ser pasion de una obsesion
Que no pueda morir

Y quisas pienses que soy
Tonto brido y tambien loco
Pero es que en el amor soy
Muy original me enamoro
Como otros
Conquisto a mi modo
Amar es mi talento te voy
A enamoro
Disculpa si te ofendo
Pero es que soy honesto
Con lujo de detalle
Escucha mi version
Pura crema e chocolate
Huntarte y devorarte
Llevarte a otro mundo

Ven vive aventura
Hagamos mil locuras
Voy a hacerte caricias

Solos nos vemos a escondidas para ahogar esta prohibida pasión
Y aunque tiene dueño, yo solo tengo un sueño, ser su protector
Somos su marido, ella y yo

Oye Don lucha por amor
No me aconsejes en tu posición
Quizás su marido no mande en su corazón
No sabes quien es victima en esta confusión

Oye mi pana lucha por amor
No, no me aconsejes en tu posición
Quizás ese tipo no mande en su corazón
Tu, no sabes quien es victima en esta confusión

Mi esposa y yo, somos felices dos almas matrices se lo que es el amor
Por eso te entiendo y aunque sea casada no
Te alejes por temor, no lo hagas Don, oh no no no

Mi amigo ella y yo teníamos claro que era una locura esta relación
Pero la carne nos llamaba, y la cama nos hacia una invitación
A solo hacer el amor

Ay ya te explique
Cuando hay personas que se aman, el amor tiene que vencer,
Y ya el marido entiende que perdió su hembra ahora es tu mujer,
No pueden ganar los tres

Y te repito lucha por amor
No me aconsejes en tu posición
Quizás su marido no mande en su corazón
No sabes quien es victima en esta confusión

No seas tan tonto lucha por amor
No, no me aconsejes en tu posición
Quizás ese tipo no mande en su corazón
Tu no sabes quien es victima en esta confusión

Amigo pido perdón yo nunca te falle,
Me traicionaron las ganas de volverla ver
Y aunque todavía no puedo creer,
Lo que este amargo encuentro me hizo comprender,
Pues tu también llegaste a ese lugar,
Donde tantas veces yo la fui a buscar
Y aunque no es fácil lo que voy a hacer
Admitiré que salí con tu mujer

Salí con tu mujer
Salí con tu mujer
Salí con tu mujer
Salí con tu mujer

Que te perdone Dios, yo no lo voy a hacer
Los perdí a los dos y a la misma vez
Ya que todo era mentira cuando ella me decía
Que se iba pa' Puerto Rico a vacaciones con su amiga
Me mintió, tu y ella en una cama, haya en Bayamo
Quizás en Isla Verde o Carolina, cuantos hoteles ensucio,
Tu también, los odio a los dos

Que yo soy quien mas sufro con todo esto,
Me mata el dolor

Fue una traición

Perdí un amigo por la tentación
Perdón

Adiós"
Latin,Aventura,Todavía Me Amas: Lo Mejor de Aventura ,Enseñame a Olvidar ,"Sera esto un sueño, que te perdi, que en verdad ya no te tengo
Cuanto quisiera cerrar mis ojos y empezar de nuevo
Sera possible poder olvidar aquel romance apasionado
Mmmm sera possible un dia decirte que por fin ya no te amo
Lo dudo mucho mi amor, es como ver a un pez del mar poder volar
Y anque te deje de amar, es imposible que te pueda olvidar

[Chorus:]
Si me enseñaste a querer tambien enseñame olvidar esto que siento
Por que eres tu niña querida la mujer a quien yo amo y a quien quiero
Quien sanara este dolor que me dejaste en mi interior cuando te fuiste
Quien invento el amor debio dar intruciones pa' evitar el sufrimiento

Llevo en mis venas la magia de tus besos el fruto de este amor
Lo veo como un juego y al fin de la jugada tu saliste ganadora
Y hoy por ti estoy sufriendo
Aprendi amar estando a tu lado
Me enseñaste a quere y me hiciste un daño
Fuiste mi profesora en el amor y en tus clases de amor
No me enseñaste de lo malo

Si me enseñaste a querer tambien enseñame olvidar esto que siento
Porque eres tu niña querida la mujer a quien yo amo y a quien quiero

[Spoken:]
Sabes te amo tanto que me da miedo volver a verte
Nooo noo nooo
Ha... let me find out

Sera tu ego que te empujo a otro hombre con dinero
Y si es asi pues tratare de resignarme por completo
Ay dios, seran tus cartas de amor, la soledad que me hace recordarte
O las novelas que tu veias tan anciosa tomando cafe
Sabes mi amor mi unica meta fue lograr tenerte aqui
Pero hoy perdi la ilusion y la esperanza de que tu vuelvas a mi

[Chorus:]
Si me enseñaste a querer tambiem enseñame olvidar esto que siento
Porque eres tu niña querida la mujer a quien yo amo y a quien quiero
(Ayyy) quien sanara este dolor que me dejaste en mi interior cuando te fuiste
Quien invento el amor debio dar intruciones para evitar el sufrimiento

Dios me ha concedido el por lo menos verte
Quizas porque rogue una ves mas tenerte
Pero hoy me he dado cuenta que no vale
Tu presencia si tu a mi ya no me amas

Cada mañanita despierta un infeliz
Y yo soy uno de ellos por que sufro por ti
Papa me dijo que no llore por mujeres y
Por ti eso es lo que hago

Show me how to forget you... oh please mi amor noono
Show me how to forget you... oh please mi amor noono
Esta noche quiero volver a verte vivir contigo una aventura [x4]"

que marcan, pero no se escriben solas
esta nació en la sierra de sinaloa

donde esta la mera mata y quedara en muchas memorias
el señor que abarco el azul del cielo
y dio sus primeros pasos, en el rancho de guisiopa Cuando niño, asaderas se vendía
para ayudar a su madresita querida
caminando entre los ranchos fue creciendo
y de la vida fue aprendiendo, cosas que no conocía
se hizo hombre y siguió con el comercio
puro producto del cerro, lo que juanjo se vendía

Aprendió de grandesito un buen talento
inteligente, tranquilo y muy discreto
en peso en las filas de pedro aviles
trabajo con miguel felix y también para don neto
amigo el hombre de caro quintero
de don mayo y juaquin y ya para que les cuento

Las balas y el trabajo no se llevan
el azul para todos es color de tregua
solo con palabras aplacaba todo
serenaba tempestades, se arreglaba con cualquiera
al gobierno sabía como manejarlo
su cerebro es para envidiarlo, hizo leña en las fronteras

Colas verdes y una goma pegajosa
fueron señores de donde jose esparragosa
los gueros lo buscan no pueden hallarlos
es camisa de once varas, para mi que ni lo tocan
se le acusa de meter por toneladas a la unión americana
drogas que ellos mismos compran

Son pasajes de don juan por su camino
y en su memoria, juan ignaciano rosalio

Porque el perjudicado siempre he sido yo... 

Y a ti, no te importo evitarme cada sufrimiento, 
Tal vez el darlo todo estuvo mal y acepto, 
Que mi ambición fue mala en esto del amor… 

En fin, me toca a mí pagar de nuevo la derrota, 
Y aunque mi corazón dejaste en banca rota, 
Empezare de cero mi reposición."

Pop,Ed Sheeran,÷ (Divide) ,Eraser ,"I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the lord's house
But stopped at the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now, the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon, that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy, when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me, is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride

You know that I've got whisky with white lies, and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point, I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up
Instead I look in the mirror, questioning what I've become
Guess it's a stereotypical day, for someone like me
Without a nine to five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors I'll find another use for the key, and you'll see

I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more
I am another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own so here I'll stay
Save your loving arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the picture perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the route of all evil, and fame is hell
Relationships and hearts you fix, they break as well
And ain't nobody want to see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream and this should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm reverend run
I beg you don't be disappointed with the man I've become

Conversations with my father on the A14
Age 12, telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people dad and they know me
With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans
Wembley stadium crowds, two hundred and forty thou
I may have grown up but I hope that Damian's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasing it now, somehow

I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said give me one more
I am, another one to take the sting away
Oh I am happy on my own so here I'll stay
Well save your loving arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
Where I'm heading who knows
My heart will stay the same

Welcome to the new show

I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way, I still remember
Those old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill"

Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I heard he's on a new diet and watches what he eats

He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy so that's fine by me

But still, I'm just keeping it real, still looking at your Instagram and I'll be creeping a little
I'll be trying not to double tap, from way back, cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind of the days when you used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't superman, just a young boy trying to be loved
So let me give it to you

I don't wanna know about your new man, cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be calling me up trying to
Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

I don't wanna know about your new man, we'll get there eventually
I know you're missing all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Your new man rents a house in the burb, and wears a man bag on his shoulder but I call it a purse
Every year he goes to Malaga, with all the fellas, drinks beer but has a six pack, I'm kind of jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors in winter at nighttime, and every time a rap song comes on
He makes a gun sign, says chune, boydem light up the room
But enough about him, girl let's talk about you
You were the type of girl that sat beside the water reading
Eating a packet of crisps but you will never find you cheating
Now you're eating kale, hitting the gym, keeping up with Kylie & Kim
In the back of the club kissing a boy that ain't him
Ok you need to be alone, and if you wanna talk about it you can call my phone
I just thought that I would tell you cause you oughta know
You're still a young girl trying to be loved
So let me give it to you

I don't wanna know about your new man, cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be calling me up trying to
Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

I don't wanna know about your new man, we'll get there eventually
I know you're missing all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Baby, I'm not trying to ruin your week
But you act so differently
When you're with him I know you're lonely
Please, remember you're still free, to make the choice and leave
And don't call me up you need to show me

I don't wanna know about your new man, cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be calling me up trying to
Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

I don't wanna know about your new man, we'll get there eventually
I know you're missing all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Know about me, know, know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man, he don't wanna know"
Pop,Ed Sheeran,÷ (Divide) ,Hearts Don't Break Around Here ,"She is the sweetest thing that I know
You should see the way she holds me when the lights go low
Shakes my soul like a pot hole, every time
Took my heart upon a one way trip
Guess she went wandering off with it
Unlike most women I know
This one will bring it back whole
Daisies, daisies perched upon your forehead
Oh my baby, lately I know

That every night I'll kiss you you'll say in my ear
Oh we're in love aren't we?
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah yeah yeah , yeah yeah yeah yeah

She is the river flow in Orwell
And tin wind chimes used for doorbells
Fields and trees and her smell, fill my lungs
Spent my summer time beside her
And the rest of the year the same
She is the flint that sparks the lighter
And the fuel that will hold the flame
Oh roses roses laid upon your bed spread
Oh my, hold this, oh this, I know

That every night I'll kiss you you'll say in my ear
Oh we're in love aren't we?
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah yeah yeah

Well I found love in the inside
The arms of a woman I know
She is the lighthouse in the night that will safely guide me home
And I'm not scared of passing over
Or the thought of growing old
Because from now until I go

Every night I'll kiss you you'll say in my ear
Oh we're in love aren't we?
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah yeah

Every night I'll kiss you you'll say in my ear
Oh we're in love aren't we?
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near

You know hearts don't break around here
Yeah yeah yeah
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah"

But God gave me a stage, a guitar and a song
My daddy told me, ""Son, don't you get involved in
Politics, religions or other people's quotes.""

I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know when I have children they will know what it means
And I pass on these things my family's given to me
Just love and understanding, positivity

We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat
And away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree
But lord knows everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing in their portfolios

Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

The revolution's coming, it's a minute away
I saw people marching in the streets today
You know we are made up of love and hate
But both of them are balanced on a razor blade

I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know, I'm all for people following their dreams
Just re-remember life is more than fittin' in your jeans
It's love and understanding, positivity

Pop,Ed Sheeran,÷ (Divide) ,How Would You Feel (Paean) ,"You are the one, girl
You know that it's true
I'm feeling younger
Every time that I'm alone with you

We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we shouldn't had asked but

How would you feel
If I told you I loved you
It's just something that I want to do
I'm taking my time, spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

In the summer, as the lilacs blew
Blood flows deeper than a river
Every moment that I spend with you

We were sat upon our best friend's roof
I had both of my arms around you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon

How would you feel
If I told you I loved you
It's just something that I want to do
I'm taking my time, spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

Pop,Ed Sheeran,÷ (Divide) ,Supermarket Flowers ,"I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
Threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved

Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me don't you cry when you're down
But mum there's a tear every time that I blink

Oh I'm in pieces it's tearing me up but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

So I'll sing Hallelujah, you were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
And when God takes you back
He'll say Hallelujah, you're home

I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John said he'd drive, then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

I hope that I see the world as you did cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived
So I'll sing Hallelujah, you were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go, when God takes you back
He'll say Hallelujah, you're home

Hallelujah, you were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person that I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back, he said Hallelujah you're home"

I bet my mother's proud of me from each scar upon my knuckle
And each graze upon my knee, and all I know is
I got a cab and then threw up on his car seat
He kicked me out and then I walked in the rain
I tell myself in every way I won't be doing this again
And tomorrow's a brand new day

Someone told me, always say what's on your mind
And I am only, being honest with you, I I get lonely
And make mistakes from time to time

I remember less and less, and mostly things that I regret
In my phone are several texts, from girls I've never met
And in the pocket of my jeans, are only coins and broken dreams
My heart is breaking at the seams
And I'm coming apart now
Now things are looking up, I'll find my shoes right next to the oak tree
And I'll get a bus straight into town
And spend the afternoon looking around for the things that I left on the ground
And say you're with me tomorrow's a brand new day

Someone told me, always say what's on your mind
And I am only, being honest with you, I I get lonely

When I met the woman I would call my own
Twenty two grand kids now growing old
In the house that your brother brought ya
On the summer day when I proposed
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
And I asked her father but her daddy said, ""No
You can't marry my daughter""

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

Well, I met at her Guys in the second world war
And she was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children now growing old
Five sons and three daughters

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

From her snow white streak in her jet black hair
Over sixty years I've been loving her
Now we're sat by the fire, in our old armchairs
You know Nancy I adore ya

From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried about the king and crown
Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
There's no difference, I assure ya

I gave away my money and now we don't even speak

Oh, honestly?

Offered up my shoulder just for you to cry upon
Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm
They gave me the heartache and in return I gave a song
It goes on and on and on

Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me, they just left me on the shelf, no farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain
Cause human beings are destined to radiate or drain
What line do we stand upon cause from here it looks the same?
And only scars remain

Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me, they just left me on the shelf, no farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

But if I don't then I'll go back to where I'm rescuing a stranger
Just because they needed saving, just like that
Oh I'm here again, between the devil and the danger
But I guess it's just my nature
My dad was wrong, cause I'm not like my mum
Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song, but it helps
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
Or drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me, they just left me on the shelf, no farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I blame someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I love someone else, I've got to love myself

[Verse 1]
Carried your burdens in my heart
Sidelined your shallow ways
It just tore me apart
I used to think I was your savior
I see through you now
You indulge in this behavior

[Chorus]
I don’t want to know you
I don’t think we should talk anymore
I want the best for you
But you’re happy being miserable
I don’t want to know you
Or someone who’s so focused on themselves
I’ll save my best for someone else

[Verse 2]
We can debate our separate views
Just look at all your roadblocks
Logic will show you truth
I’ve hid in shadows, wrestled demons
But I won’t deny it because I know how to defeat them

[Chorus]
I don’t want to know you
I don’t think we should talk anymore
I want the best for you
But you’re happy being miserable
I don’t want to know you
Or someone who’s so focused on themselves
I’ll save my best for someone else

When you throw me under the bus
Back it up and run me over
If I always catch your fall
You will never hit the surface to feel it all
You gotta feel it all

I don’t want to know you
I don’t think we should talk anymore
I want the best for you
But you’re happy being miserable
I don’t want to know you
Or someone who’s so focused on themselves
I’ll save my best for someone else
I’ll save my best for someone else
(I don’t want to know you, I don’t want to know you)
I’ll save my best for someone else

I’ll save my best for someone else"

I must be honest
Under the surface
It grinds like a blender
The sound of two voices

It put me in a stranger's bed
It hurt who I love the most
I'll never trust it again

That's why I don't want what I want
'Cause what I want, it just might kill me
And I won't think of my needs
'Cause what I need, I know there's never enough for me

Envy is endless
I used to put mistakes up on a board
Compare how mine sticks
Next to the rest of the worlds'
That got me nowhere but miles from changing

And bleach won't erase them

'Cause I can't see how it looks from your perspective
Call me on everything 'cause I can't help myself
And I need your protection from me
I lose every time
I lose every time
I lose every time
You think you're inspiring
Posting slogans on a photo of the sky
You're letting sleeping dogs lie
It's not so simple as
Do what makes you happy
If that's the same thing
That will destroy me

[Chorus]
That's why I don't want what I want
'Cause what I want, it just might kill me
And I won't think of my needs
'Cause what I need, I know there's never enough for me
I must be honest
(For me)
Under the surface
It grinds like a blender
(I know there's never enough for me)
The sound of two voices
My heart seems to fail me
(For me)
It put me in a stranger's bed
It hurt who I love the most
(What I need, I know there's never enough for me)
I'll never trust it again"

When we first me, I doubted myself
Could someone love to the level you do?
Or are you just excited for a fresh start?
Had reservations, I was dumb to assume
But it's all that I knew
It's all that I knew
Had blurred vision from all my head wounds
A victim of my own bitterness
A life I almost missed
I kick myself when I think of it

I'm giving up love
I'm giving up love
You're the one, love

[Verse 2]
When I think back, I still get a feeling
I'm so ashamed of all the time that it took
For me to open my eyes
You brought me back when I was lost and confused
But it's all that I knew
It's all that I knew
Had blurred vision from all my head wounds
A victim of my own stubbornness
A life I almost missed
I curse myself when I think of it

Pop,New Found Glory,Makes Me Sick ,The Cheapest Thrill ,"[Verse 1]
I was a teenager, delusional
With such an awkward build
That's why the first time she sent me a look
I swore she was my world
A week later, got cheated on
A pay-by-hour hotel
I guess she thought that's what my future's worth
A twenty dollar bill
I damn the world, shooting fire from my eyes
But behind them I was burning
Now I'm the lie

[Chorus]
I'm the cheapest thrill
I'm the cheapest thrill
And everyone can tell that I'm the cheapest thrill
And I can barely stand myself

[Verse 2]
Clearly I was crazy
The first to give advice
Played it up like I was noble
But I was feeding my own pride
The lengths I'd go for a fix
Tacky charm got me far
Must have hurt so many feelings
While stabbing my own heart
I damn the world, shooting fire from my eyes
But behind them I was burning
Now I'm the lie

[Chorus]
I'm the cheapest thrill
I'm the cheapest thrill
And everyone can tell that I'm the cheapest thrill
And I can barely stand myself

Suddenly I can see through my own eyes again
But I don't like what I'm feeling
You can't help your thoughts
But you can change your actions
If I don't I'll be consumed

Now I'm the cheapest thrill
I'm the cheapest thrill
And everyone can tell that I'm the cheapest thrill
And I can barely stand myself
I know now I'm not going back
I know my own worth now
(And I can barely stand myself)
I know now I'm not going back
I know my own worth now

I know now I'm not going back
I know my own worth now

City of stars
Are you shining just for me?

There's so much that I can't see
Who knows?
I felt it from the first embrace I shared with you
(That now our dreams
They've finally come true)

[Mia's Verse: Emma Stone & (Ryan Gosling)]
City of stars
Just one thing everybody wants
There in the bars
And through the smokescreen of the crowded restaurants
It's love
Yes, all we're looking for is love from someone else
(A rush)
A glance
(A touch)
A dance

[Duet: Ryan Gosling & Emma Stone]
A look in somebody's eyes
To light up the skies
To open the world and send it reeling
A voice that says, I'll be here
And you'll be alright

I don't care if I know
Just where I will go
'Cause all that I need is this crazy feeling
A rat-tat-tat on my heart

Think I want it to stay

Are you shining just for me?

Pop,Soundtrack,Fifty Shades Darker ,What Is Love? ,"Does anyone really know how to love?
Does anyone really feel what they dreamt of?

Or is it all a puzzle maze
But we never actually walk out the other side

We go round and round and round
Taking wrong times
And clinging to the edges of ourselves

What is this thing that we called love?
What is this thing that I dreamt of?
What is this thing that with such a rush?
What is this thing that we called love?

What is love?
Oh, what is love?

You think you felt it all
But then it hits
A comet from above
Crashes into your lips

And suddenly you find yourself
Thinking of things you never thought of before

And something in you changes
You can't think of anything else
Apart from the person that left a rose by your door

What is this thing that we called love?
What is this thing that I dreamt of?
What is this thing that with such a rush?
What is this thing that we called love?

What is love?
Oh, what is love?
What is love?
Oh, what is love?

What is this thing that we called love?
What is this thing that I dreamt of?
What is this thing that with such a rush?
What is this thing that we called love?

What is this thing that we called love?"

He put it on me better than any other guy
He said he need a bad bitch with an alibi
Yo, give me the muny, the yen and the pesos
Sext me on the beach in Turks and Caicos
I give him that work, that twerk that slay hoes
Sippin' Grey Goose, and pushin' that grey ghost
Uh, assume the position when you see a bad one
The D so good, he just got a And 1
I'm about to blow, and I ain't talking Samsung
I'm about to show him what I do with that tongue

I always believed that love will surrender
And I wouldn't go down without a fight
I always left room for other contenders
'Cause I might change my mind

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Damn, I used to be so cold
We never ever get too close
Didn't ever wanna lose control
But from the moment that I tasted
I knew that I would have to chase it
You say hold up, I won't you to be

[Chorus]
A one woman man
A one woman man, oh
Want you all to my side
Don't want nobody else
Oh, you love it
Oh, you love it
Won't you be
A one woman man (one woman)
A one woman man, oh (one woman)

[Verse 2]
You made me believe that love was forever
And love could sustain us through every fight
I'll let go of all of the other
Pretenders they were wasting my time

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I never thought that I would say this
But I can see us having babies
I could see it from the stars
That I might give you my heart
From the moment that I met you
Knew that I would never let you
Slip away, it's okay
You can make me

Want you all to my side

I can never say I loved you
I kept all my gold
But you broke in my house
You've stolen my heart
Now I've given you the key
Got all of you for all of me
But baby, I promise you'll be

A one woman man, oh
Want you all to myself
